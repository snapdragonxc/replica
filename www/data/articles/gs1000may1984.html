<p>Last year was a watershed in the history of motorcycle sport, for a number of reasons, and in a number of ways. For while in Grand Prix racing the dawn of a new age arrived with Freddie Spencer's and Honda's first 500cc title, and the subsequent retirement of "King" Kenny, in the less rarefied world of production-derived machinery, the end of one era took place, coupled inevitably with the start of another.
</p>
<p>For at the end of the 1983 season the TT Formula 1 rules, which govern not only the World TT F1 championship run on road courses like the Isle of Man and Ulster, but also the World Endurance Championship, saw a reduction in the upper capacity limit from the 1000cc mark in force since their indtroduction in 1977 to one of 750cc. One year earlier, a similar move had taken place in the USA, where the Superbike class limit was reduced to 750cc multis, and 1000cc twins. The day of the brutish, ultra-powerful (and ultra-fast) one-litre hyperbikes was over, except for a handful of races such as the Classic TT and Daytona 200 where this exciting but endangered species, the most powerful bikes the racing world has ever known, continue to be raced. And probably even there not for much longer.</p>
<p>All of this made Rob McElnea's victory in the 1983 Classic TT all the more significant, for it was achieved on a bike which, when the history of the megapower 1000cc racers comes to be written, will almost certainly be regarded as the leader of the pack: the GS1000 Suzuki, known in its highly modified works form as the XR69. Developed by Pops Yoshimura on behalf of the Japanese manufacturer, the XR69 not only won a host of races in Superbike form in North America for the Yoshimura team - notably four in a row in the Daytona 100-miler - but also enabled Suzuki to score a pair of World TT F1 titles in 1981/82 over their bitter Honda rivavls, thanks in no small measure to the brilliance of Graeme Crosby. And when Croz moved on to the GP world with almost equal success, Suzuki's run of victories with the XR69 continued in 1982 with Roger Marshall, who dominated British short circuit racing with a pair of updated machines, winning the British F1, MCN Superbike and ACU British Road Racing titles with a series of victories that aptly earned him the nickname of "Win-a-Week" Marshall.
</p>
<p>A lucrative Honda contract enticed Roger away from Suzuki for the 1983 season, leaving his brace of '82 model XR69s to be split up between veteran Mick Grant and newcomer to the team Rob McElnea; Grant was assigned a lightweight alloy-frame version into the bargain. But instead of the seasoned campaigner, it was the husky, good-looking rookie McElnea who posed Suzuki's greatest challenge to Honda's eventual World and British TT1 champions Dunlop and Gardner, winding up second in both championships using just a single bike all season which was, moreover, theoretically at any rate, inferior to his team-mate's. From the moment that Rob won the second British round at Thruxton in pouring rain, it was obvious that Suzuki had made an inspired choice, later confirmed for them by his superb victory in front of 160 000 people at Assen in the first World TT1 title round to be held in Holland. But two weeks beforehand McElnea had pulled off a prestigious triumph in the Isle of Man by registering a surprise win in the world's richest road race, the Classic TT, at a record average speed of 114.61 mph: it was amazingly only his second IoM TT year.</p>
<p>The machine which Rob used throughout 1983, and on which he scored that TT win, has been retained by Heron Suzuki, unlike most of its predecessors which have been returned to Japan at the end of their competitive life for an appointment with the crusher. Probably its last outing on a racetrack was in November '83. a couple of weeks after Rob McElnea had taken it to victory in its final race in the last round of the British TT1 series at Brands Hatch, when it was bought back to the same circuit courtesy of Suzuki team manager Rex White for me to sample before it took up the sedentary occupation of museum life. Having ridden Wayne Gardner's British TT1 title-winning RS850R V4 Honda only a week beforehand, it was a unique opportunity to compare the two bitter rivals, one the epitome of the old one-litre hyperbikes, the other the vanguard of the new wave of 750s.</p>
<p>Having first appeared in 1980, before the advent of the 16-valve GSX series, the XR69 is based on the older GS1000 8-valver - Suzuki's original 4-stroke superbike. Though Yoshimura did obtain some appreciably higher horsepower figures from a GSX engine, attempts to run one in a Katana chassis in the 1982 US Superbike series with Wes Cooley aboard were not successful, primarily due to piston problems. With the imminent reduction of the upper capacity limit to 750 cc, Suzuki persevered to the end of the one-litre formula with the 8-valve engine. The in-line unit sits high in the XR-69's tubular steel frame, essentially the same as when the model first appeared in Croz's hands in 1980, but with periodic detail improvements. For 1983 the principal modification made to the highly tuned engine was the fitting of an 18-plate dry clutch in place of the wet multiplate unit used before, while the most obvious other external departure from the standard road bike engine is the fitting of dual ignition powered by a Nippondenso CDI unit. According to Suzuki's specialist F1 mechanic, Dave "Junior" Collins, the twin-plug head transforms the engine, eliminating detonation, reducing flame travel and improving the carburation to the point where the engine is much more responsive at all revolutions. It allowed the team to run much leaner on jetting, as well as to reduce the ignition advance from 37 degree advance with the single, offset plug, to only 25 degree with the dual ignition - a considerable improvement.
</p>
<p>Inside the engine Pops fitted oversize valves (39mm inlet compared to the original 38mm, and 37mm exhaust as against 32mm) matched to racing camshafts offering 10.3mm lift instead of the street engine's 8mm on the inlet, and 9.3mm (7.5mm) on the exhaust. 11.8:1 compression is used, but the Japanese pistons originally fitted were found to have a life of only 500 miles before cracking, causing Heron Suzuki to go shopping at Omega's in Britain for specially made forged pistons which last four times longer; I wonder how the HB-Suzuki endurance team that won the '83 World title with the same engine mounted in an alloy chassis overcame this problem? A strengthened built-up crankshaft and tougher conrods are fitted, with the crank welded up to prevent it twisting, and the end covers chamfered off to provide extra ground clearance. The 70 x 64.8mm 998cc engine produces 134bhp at 9500 rpm, measured at the gearbox sprocket, running on four magnesium-bodied 33.4mm Mikuni smoothbore carbuettors whose choke size is dictated by TT Formula regulations. Peak revs normally used are 10500 rpm.</p>
<p>The Suzuki's a big bike by any standards even just to sit on, though the 56.5" wheelbase is compact by the standards of big racing four-strokes and the dry weight of 160kg (325lb) a tribute to the extensive use of magnesium and other weight-trimming ideas: that's with a stainless steel exhaust and the steel frame, too, remember - the '84 bikes with their alloy chassis and titanium exhausts scale around 8kg less still. But thanks to the fact that Rob McElnea is a six-footer like me I found the riding position made to measure, though when getting on it for the first time I noticed at once that he has the clipons flat, sticking out at almost right angles into the airstream. Strange, I thought ... but soon I would find out why!</p>
<p>Once encouraged into life the XR69 settled down to a fast idle even with the chokes off, and on a surprisingly warm autumn day the wet sump engine's oil supply was soon warm enough for me to venture out on to the track. While poodling round to get the hang of the bike, I found the 3000rpm idle quite disconcerting: braking for Druids Hairpin was like having the throttle jammed open on you, and I doubt if Rob would have the carburation set up like that for rounding Governor's Bridge on the TT course. But at Brands once I started riding hard I even found it an advantage in that I could coast round Druids with just a whisker of throttle applied to keep the engine on song, before opening up coming out of the corner. Usuable power comes in as low down as 4000rpm, which with the 10500rpm maximum makes for an exceptionally wide power band - contrary to my expectations, I must admit - though there's a patch of megaphonitis around 5500 revs and real TT-winning herds of fire-breathing horses only arrive at 7000rpm. But Suzuki's far from the all-or-nothing monster I'll admit I'd expected to encounter, though it is VERY important not to crank the beautifully light throttle (as are the other controls: guaranteed sign of a works motorcycle) wide open coming out of a corner, else you'll land on your ear faster than you can spell disaster.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I found that out the hard way: after 15 laps or so of the 1.2 mile circuit, with its numerous off-camber corners which mean acceleration on a bike as powerful as the Suzuki must be treated with care, I'd grown confident on the bike to the point of trying a bit harder on it. Trying to get maximum drive out of Clearways before the rush down the Pit straight, I applied just a touch too much throttle and was rewarded with a full-blooded slide as frantically with my knees, I fought the bars to regain control and somehow managed to succeed in doing so - but it had been a near thing. I realised then one reason McElnea has the bars spread so far on the bike, because though the handling is steady the steering is very heavy at the best of times, and the extra leverage of the wide bars must make it much easier to ride. Or rather, less difficult, because the combination of all that power and the bulky, in-line engine set high in the frame for necessary ground clearance makes for a top-heavy bike that requires a considerable degree of what American magazines call "rider input": in other words, it's bloody hard work to ride at or near the limit! Suzuki have helped by steepening the head angle by special yokes for the 40mm Kayaba forks, but it still requires a fair degree of effort just to flip the bike from side to side as for example in the South Bank/Clearways esses. And because you're going so fast, the problem is exacerbated.</p>
<p>And fast you certainly do go, because the 130-plus horsepower shoved out by the factory unit propels the XR69 at incredible velocities for a road based engine. Top speed of the bike is 170mph on Isle of Man gearing (though it has been timed at 305kph (189mph) in testing in Japan), while even the 15/48 gearing fitted for Brands Hatch gives 156mph at 10500rpm. I don't mind admitting that the best I saw on the revcounter before shutting off seemingly suicidally late for Paddock Bend was 9000rpm, but even that's 134mph, achieved on a stretch of road less than 700 yards long that on most other bikes is an undulating straight, but which on the Suzuki became a long, long right hander with a short, straight entry to the right-hander at Paddock. The bike accelerates so fast and goes so quickly that straights turn into bends, and bends turn into hairpins. Compared to its V4 Honda rival, the Suzuki definitely has an edge on acceleration, even taking into account the Honda's deceptively lazy V4 gait.</p>
<p>Becoming gradually accustomed to the Suzuki's awesome performance, I discovered nonetheless that it's really a controllable bike at those speeds provided you're prepared to ride it on the throttle and really work at getting it round fast. The Kayaba suspension, matched at the rear to Suzuki's Full-Floater rising-rate design was perfectly suited to my weight (about the same as Rob's, I suppose), and the XR69 was the only bike I've ever ridden round Paddock Bend at Brands on which I literally didn't notice the notorious and off-putting bump right on the apex: it rode superbly, and must have made a great IoM bike. The front end wasn't so good in a couple of places, though - notably when cranked hard over to the left sweeping down through Bottom Bend, when i chattered quite considerably, and again coming out of Clearways with the power applied when the front wheel started flapping once it ran over the ripples on the exit. On one lap this developed into a full-blooded tank-slapper that continued all the way down the pit "straight": though it didn't really feel as if it were evver going to get out of hand. I decided to head for the pits to check everything was OK and inspect the steering damper mounted under the tank on the left. The concensus of opinion was that this was probably tired out, but now I know why a broken damper is a valid cause for retirement from a race on GP and works TT1 bikes when everything else is functioning perfectly: carrying on an making the best of things is probably the next best thing to writing your own hospital admission form.</p>
<p>Hauling the Suzuki down from its considerable top speed for corners was easily accomplished thanks to the massive twin 310mm front discs, though the lever action for the RG500-type calipers felt a bit dead and the hydraulic anti-dive didn't retain as much feel as on the v4 Honda I rode. I hardly used the rear 220mm disc, since when I did at the start of my ride I got a bit of a rear wheel hop (probably simply through stamping on it too hard), and with all that engine braking on tap I really didn't feel I needed it. One nice feature was that I could go deep into a tight corner like Druids with the brakes hard on, without having the bike sit up and understeer on me as it would have done with a 16" front wheel fitted. On the other hand, replacing the 18" front wheel with a 16" one would surely have lightened the steering. In this respect I suppose the XR69 really belongs to a different generation than its Honda rival, which was certainly much easier and less tiring to ride hard. However, the Suzuki's power unit is almost as flexible as the Honda's even if the power delivery is a bit more sudden, which does enable you to smoothen out some of the cornering problems. The close ratio gearbox has a nice spread of gears, even if the actual gearchange (left side, one up, five down) is a bit notchy and "mechanical". Allied to the tremendous torque of the engine it enabled me to short-shift coming out of Druids, for example, so as to be able to take Bottom Bend in fourth at about 6000rpm, which lessened the impact of the front end chattering there, then hold fourth all the way along the back straight (just another long curve on the Suzy), running up to 10000rpm before braking and flicking the bike into South Bank, still in fourth, then coming down just one gear for Clearways, which again made getting a good drive on coming out of the corner easier to obtain without the rear end braking away too sharply.</p>
<p>After a total of 45 laps round Brands on this TT-winning bike, using the same engine that won Suzuki the 1983 World Endurance title, I can only say that my respect for the men who rode the XR69 to victory on the circuits of the world has been increased. Unlike the RS850R Honda, which almost any competent rider could go fast on with the minimum pf practice, the Suzuki requires a real expert to wring the most from it, though the potential for someone of Rob McElnea's undoubted class to win with the bike is phenomenal. My session on the bike left me with arms and shoulders tired and aching from the sheer effort of riding the bike, seeking to assert my mastery over a fire-eating motorcycle that would cheerfully have spat me off soon as look at me. My best time during the day had been 52sec - yet the TT1 lap record is in the 49-second bracket, which gives some idea of how far I still had to go before reaping the maximum potential out of the bike. Big, meaty, powerful and fast, the XR69 Suzuki represents a disappearing age in motorcycle competition, when musclebikes were just that, and only men of iron could ride them on the limit. Rob McElnea is one such man: now I know why his shoulders are as broad as they are!</p>
