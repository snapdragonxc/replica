<p><b>Well, well. After all that waiting they finally arrived. Yamaha's FZ and Suzuki's GSX-R 750s are THE bikes of '85 and we couldn't resist the opportunity to run them side by side. Life does indeed have its brighter moments.</b></p>
<p>If 1983 was the year of the 750 and 1984 the year of the megablasters then 1985 will surely be remembered as the year the accent shifted - with a resounding thud - back to 750s. Resounding because the new breed of 750 delivers performance over and above the level of the big-bores released the year before! No mean feat, and understandably we've been hanging out to wrap our itchy fingers around the respective throttles of the two newies. But, like all good things the FZ and GSX-R have taken a while to arrive. You know the story: the bikes should start trickling in by the end of the month etc, etc. As it turned out both the FZ and GSX-R arrived at around the same time, so naturally the scene was set for a very interesting comparo.
</p>
<p>Prior to the arrival of the Suzuki the Australian motorcycle press was invited for a preview ride of Yamaha's red and white bullet around the recently resurfaced Oran Park, and despite pleas from the Yamaha staff not to concentrate too much on top-end power the FZ spent more time at close to redline revs than anywhere else - irresponsible lot! But we did at least attempt to do the right thing and run a few roll-ons between the 750 and the newer bigger capacity XJ900. The super grunty XJ is only slightly quicker in the 80 to 120 km/h range, and from 140 km/h on the FZ is superior. The FZ convincingly won rollling start drags against the XJ and the RZ500. So we came away impressed. Yamaha's new 750 was a very sweet, neutral handler and very, very quick.</p>
<p>Few punters would have predicted that by 1985 the benchmark for power output of a 750 sportster would rise to the magic ton in horsepower. Well, it has now! Yamaha claim 75.0 kW (100.7 hp) for the FZ and Suzuki 73.6 kW (98.8 hp) for the GSX-R. That, in anyone's terms, is a lot of power for a 750 and if manufacturers' claims are varified then it's only the tip of the iceberg. Between 130 and 140 hp is rumoured to be the maximum output for the race-kitted versions.</p>
<h1>Fast enough</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, as the dyno is again inoperable, precise verification of the bikes' power output was impossible, but from the way they performed a pretty accurate estimate of the rear wheel power and torque curves can be obtained. Maximum power of the FZ would be very close to 59.8 kW (80.3 hp) at 10,500 rpm, while the GSX-R's peak would be slightly less - 59.3 kW (79.6 hp), also at 10,500 rpm.
</p>
<p>It's these figures, along with the relatively short gearing encouraged by the 11,000 rpm redlines, that leads to the ridiculously quick acceleration from the two beasties. It's merely a matter of twisting the throttle and snapping through the gears. As quick as a flash the speedo needles have slipped well past the 200 km/h mark. Top speeds - 232 km/h for the GSX-R and 228 km/h for the FZ - show the true mettle of the new 750s.</p>
<p>The rocket-like performance of this amazing pair comes from two very different motors. Just about the only shared features are the four cylinder layout, the double overhead camshafts, and alternators mounted behind the cylinder bank. Each donk represents an innovative and completely different approach to design.</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the new Suzuki is, of course, the SACS (Suzuki Advanced Cooling System) in which oil is used to regulate engine temperature. This system uses a high volume oil pump which circulates four times as much oil as the air-cooled GSX750's. Two separate systems are involved - one for cooling and the other for lubrication. For cooling, oil is directed under pressure to the outsides for the combustion chambers, sprayed onto the underside of each piston and cooled after passing through a large radiator-size oil cooler. Suzuki has used piston cooling before (on the GSX750ESD), but the rest is all new.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for using oil rather than water cooling was weight minimisation and further evidence of Suzuki's intent in this area is everywhere. Computer stress analysis using finite element calculus (Anybody got a gun? - Ed.) has been used to devise the lightest and strongest crankshaft/conrod/piston assembly possible, the rocker cover is made from magnesium and a lightweight four-into-one exhaust system is fitted.</p>
<p>Yamaha hasn't really taken the same single-minded approach to weight minimisation but has attended more to the reduction of dimensions. The motor is not as tall as the GSX-R's, and not as wide as the unimported XJ400 four. Consequently, it has been set quite low in the frame with the obvious benefit of a low centre of gravity. In fact, Yamaha has taken other steps to keep the weight close to the road. The cylinder block has a forward inclination of 45 degrees, and the area under the tank, directly above the cylinder head, is occupied by the airbox. The bulk of the fuel tank's capacity is behind rather than above the motor.</p>
<p>But the most publicised and significant feature is the five-valve head. An unnecessary complication or complexity with a purpose? The later is definitely the case. A motor with such power and more midrange urge than any other four-cylinder four valve 750 certainly justifies Yamaha's use of the five-valve design.
</p>
<p>The decision to use three inlet and two exhaust valves was based on a number of factors. Three inlet valves with the same total surface area as two larger ones will result in substantially greater induction flow if lift remains constant, so increased induction flow has been gained with quite moderate cam profiles. And there are other benefits. Smaller valves allow for a flatter combustion chamber shape and narrow valve angles for greater power. Yamaha has taken the idea a little further by using pistons with slightly concave tops and a high (11.2:1) compression ratio - still more power and high efficiency. Lighter, smaller valves alone mean that the motor can rev out safely to very high rpm.
</p>
<p>Aside from the five valves per cylinder feature the FZ's motor is brimming with other innovations that illustrate the thoroughness of the company's approach. Valve stems are waisted to promote a less restrictive gas flow through the inlet and exhaust ports, and single-valve springs are used on the light valves to enhance responsiveness and reduce high rpm float. Valve clearances are set by under-bucket shims but Yamaha suggests that shim replacements (which involves removal of the camshafts) will be a rare procedure since the light valve and spring assembly will lead to very little seat wear.</p>
<p>Both inlet and exhaust tract design has also been the result of some consientious exercising of the grey matter. Since the cylinder bank has a forward incliniation, the downdraft carburettors (34 mm constant vacuum Mikunis) are located above the level of the head and feed the cylinders via quite long inlet ducts. This does mean that a fuel pump is necessary, but the inlet tracts are, unlike most other normal types (aside from the GPz900R's), the same length, so this enhances even cylinder filling. Since the cylinder bank leans forward the headers don't need to have any sharp bends to avoid contact with the front guard. The fact that the headers from cylinders one and four/two and three are connected separately, and not run into a commong collector box, means that exhaust efficiency is higher than normal.</p>
<p>There are a new more neat touches. The upper deck of the motor is split into two levels: a camshaft case which carries the cams and the cylinder head with the valve gear. Yamaha contends that this set-up allowed the positioning of the valve geat to be done independently of the head bolts, so the whole box and dice could be very narrow. More than fifty bolts hold the top-end together - great for strength but imagine doing a strip-down!</p>
<p>Neatest touch of all is the ignition system. The pulser coils are attached by one bolt to each side of the engine cases and are triggered by slots machined into the outer crankshaft webs. When the slot passes the coil the magnetic field collapses and you've got a spark. Unless you blow the motor up the ignition timing stays spot on.</p>
<p>In contrast, Suzuki has taken more traditional steps in the search for more power. Compared to earlier 750s the GSX-R has more oversquare bore and stroke dimensions (GSX-R: 70.0 x 48.7 mm - EFF: 67.0 x 53.0) and the larger bore, together with the smaller 10 mm spark plug, means there's room for bigger valves. Valve sizes are up, cam lift has been increased dramatically judging by the huge valve cutouts in the pistons, and the combustion chamber shape has been altered so the quenching zooms no longer extend beyond the profile of the bore. Straight inlet tracts, 29 mm flat slide carburettors and a four-into-one exhaust system all do their bit to maximise top end power.</p>
<p>The different approaches by the two manufacturers in the design of the motors leads to an expected difference in their behaviour. The GSX-R750 looks much like the 400, and this similarity in style is reflected in the spread of power.</p>
<p>Up to 5000 rpm the Suzuki is quite sprightly but then the power increase slows across the midrange trough up to 7500 rpm. At around 8000 rpm the fireworks are released. You've then got superb acceleration right up to 11,200 where the rev limiter stops any further progress into the red zone. Unlike the 400 the rev limiter is no impediment to rapid acceleration; it's just not necessary to go past 10,500 rpm for blitzing performance.</p>
<p>In contrast the FZ is the grunter. Low down power is on par with the GSX but the midrange is much stronger. There is a slight lull between 4500 and 6000 rpm but above that it's sparks all the way to 11,800 rpm where the iginition cuts out.</p>
<p>Top gear roll-ons well illustrate the relative difference in power delivery. From 60 km/h (around 2700 rpm) the FZ, through its greater responsiveness, sets up a two bike length buffer. This gap remains unchanged up to 100 km/h. From 80 km/h this situation is repeated.</p>
<p>Rolling-on from 100 km/hr and keeping the throttles open until the speedos read 200 km/h shows that the GSX-R doesn't really begin to give its best until the silly side of 160 km/h. Again the FZ pulls out a few bike lengths and this margin is maintained up to 125 km/h (around 6000 rpm) when the Yamaha starts pulling away again. There's at least a half dozen bike lengths in it at 200 km/h. Only when rolling on at above 160 km/h (around 7600 rpm) is the contest even stevens.</p>
<p>Don't get the idea though that the GSX is very peaky. It isn't. Certainly the bulk of the power is concentrated in the upper reaches but responsiveness is good at any engine speed. It's just that the R is overshadowed by the superb midrange of the FZ. The VF750 has met its match.</p>
<h1>?? by a whisker</h1>
<p>Simple physics dictates that with two bikes boasting equivalent top ends and gearing the lightest will accelerate faster. The GSX is more than 30 kg lighter than the FZ and is quicker over the 400 metres. But only just. Other factors will narrow the leeway to 0.1 secs. The peakier Suzuki is more difficult to get off the line cleanly because it's more difficult to find an appropriate balance between wheelspin and bogging down. And it isn't easy keeping the Suzuki's front wheel out of the sky during drag starts. Hasty take-offs will often result in big monos. At the strip the GSX-R will return 11.5 seconds at a terminal speed of 188 km/h, while the FZ clocks 11.6 at 184 km/h.</p>
<p>Fuel consumption is an area where the bikes aren't as close. Yamaha's trumpet-blowing about fuel efficiency seem to have a sound basis. The FZ is very economical. 20.1 km/litre on a steady cruise and 18.2 km/litre around town are excellent figures considering the power available and its good spread. Thorough thashing doesn't increase the consumption to high levels either. The GSX-R could only manage a cruising rate of 17.7 km/litre, a miserable 14.8 km/litre in town, and a hard riding rate of 13.1 km/litre.</p>
<p>Both motors are smooth, and surprisingly the GSX-R hasn't inherited the midrange buzz of earlier Suzukis. The motor throbs at low revs but is beautifully smooth everywhere else. Unfortunately the FZ does have a band of vibration between 4000 and 5000 rpm but the motor isn't overly harsh in that region and is super smooth below and above.</p>
<p>The sportster nature of the GSX-R's motor is carried through to the rest of the bike's make-up. If styling gives a strong indication of the bike's intent then this is backed up by the riding position and taut suspension. The GSX-R is taller than the FZ and with the higher footpegs and narrower bars you lean well forward. It's not quite El Ducati stuff, but it's reasonably close. The knees certainly have the good-old sportster bend but this isn't too annoying apart from the fact that riders of average height will find that their knees don't fit under the sharpish edge on the tank sides very well.</p>
<p>The riding position on the FZ is more biased toward the all-rounder concept. Footpegs are lower, the knees aren't at such an acute angle, and the bars are wider and higher so you adopt a more neutral stance which is fine for commuting, touring or scratching.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the difference in the two bikes' power spread is only the tip of the iceberg as each one's general feel and behaviour is also very distinctive. The GSX-R grumbles away at an uneven idle, and as the revs build up a beautiful throaty roar begins to emanate from the four-into-one. The Yamaha sounds less aggresively sporty, has more engine braking, and is much more sensitive (overly so) to slight throttle changes.</p>
<h1>Hardware</h1>
<p>Both Suzuki and Yamaha have developed sophisticated frame and suspension packages for their new 750s. The GSX-R boasts a rectangular-section alloy frame of similar construction to the 400, 18-inch wheels front and rear, a monoshock rear suspension which is labelled a Full Floater but isn't, and progressively damped front forks. Yamaha has fitted ist flagship with a rectangular section steel frame, an 18-inch rear and 16-inch front wheel, monoshock rear suspension and variably damped front forks.
</p>
<p>The GSX-R's forks have four spring preload settings, and four-step adjustability on the Posidamp unit while the FZ's front end is air assisted. Both 750s have systems which increase compression damping towards the end of the fork stroke but while the Suzuki relies on the position of a valve in the Posidamp unit, the Yamaha's damping increases as the forks compress because the location and size of damping passages changes through the fork stroke, thus increasing the resistance to flow of the damping fluid.</p>
<p>At the rear of the GSX-R's monoshock spring preload can be adjusted by the rotation of a knurled collar at the base of the unit, while the FZ's shock has a similar continuous range and can be altered by removal of the right sidecover and rotation of a nut on the remote adjuster. This nut is connected to a shaft with a small sprocket and a roller chain which runs from the adjuster to another sprocket on the shock body. As the preload is changed the rebound damping is correspondingly altered, but the damping rate can be set independently. The FZ has nine settings for rebound damping while the GSX-R has four.</p>
<p>In keeping with the super-sports aura, the GSX-R has firmer suspension and shorter travel at both ends. But this doesn't lead to a particularly harsh ride; the bike feels taut - not rough - and the rear suspension behaves much more progressively than the FZ's unit which soaks up initial travel too readily and consequently feels overly firm over moderately bumpy roads. The FZ's front end is good enough though. It dives more than the Suzuki under brakes but there's no "Yamaha plummet" - a characteristic of other models like the FJ1100 and the earlier RZ250 and 350.</p>
<p>Handling on bothe bikes was excellent. The GSX-R at 176 kg dry is 33 kg lighter than the FZ, and the Suzuki feels much lighter when manoeuvring and at low speed. But at higher speeds the FZ feels more agile. The 16-inch fron wheel, rake and trail dimensions of 25.5 degrees and 94 mm respectively, plus its low centre of gravity encourage quicker steering whereas the Suzuki's 18-inch front wheel, 26 degrees of rake and 107 mm trail are biased more toward slower steering response.
</p>
<p>But this isn't the end of the story. Although the figures for front/rear weight distribution aren't available it's likely that the Yamaha has much more weight on the front wheel than the Suzuki. This probably explains the fact that at low speeds (below 40 km/h) the Suzuki steers almost as quickly as the FZ, and could also be the reason why FZ is by no means ultra quick or nervous at any speed.
</p>
<h1>Twisties and sweepers</h1>
<p>In other words around very tight curves and flip flops the FZ feels very much at home. Steering is precise, the bike is beautifully balanced and it's a cinch to change lines quickly. If the adrenalin is really flowing you will find that the footpegs fold up but no solid underpinnings will touch down before the tyres lose adhesion. In more open territory the FZ is equally delightful and bumpy roads scarcely affected front end stability. At high speed the bike is very stable and confidence inspiring.</p>
<p>So too is the GSX-R. At ultra-high speeds it has a steadiness which could just about be labelled the "Italian feel". The supreme steering precision, the light weight and immense cornering clearance really earn the GSX-R the "Super Sports" tag, and if the Yamaha feels at home in the tight stuff the Suzuki has a permanent mortgage on the sweepers.</p>
<p>But there is one unfortunate factor in the Suzuki's on-road behaviour. The lightness and lack of front-end weight bias means that on really aggressive throttle operation the front tyre barely skims the road. Consequently if a series of savage bumps is hit in this situation the front end can get very excited and twitchy. In a way it's a pity Suzuki didn't stay with the 16-inch front wheel and the weight distribution of the GSX-R400, which handles bumpy roads without fuss. Strange as it may seem, the 16-inch Yamaha front end is better in the rough.</p>
<p>Of course if you're not applying a fistful this isn't a problem, but when aboard the GSX-R the temptation to do this is often too hard to resist.</p>
<p>One of the outstanding features of the GSX-R is its brakes. The large front discs with the dual twin piston calipers are powerful and provide excellent feel. The small rear disc with the underslung twin piston fixed caliper is equally impressive. Yamaha has fitted the FZ with ventilated discs and twin piston fixed calipers all round, and although the bike isn't as eager under brakes as the Suzuki this is more through the Suzuki's lower weight than any deficiency in the FZ's stoppers. It's relatively easy to reach the traction limit of the front tyre on the FZ and still the Suzuki pulls up in a shorter distance. The Yamaha's brakes are, however, not as good in the feedback department as the Suzuki's, and the rear is pretty insensitive.</p>
<p>Another area where Suzuki wins the battle is in transmission smoothness. Both bikes run gear primary drive, six-speed gearboxes and hydraulic clutches but the GSX-R certainly has the most refined system. The clutch is very progressive and has a relatively wide take-up for a hydraulically-activated number, while the gearshift action is snappy and very precise. As a bonus there's not a trace of transmission freeplay.</p>
<p>The FZ's change action is not nearly as sharp, the clutch has a narrower take-up and the transmission slop is excessive - to put it mildly. The Yamaha almost takes the crown from the VF1000F as the bike with the "loosest" transmission in modern motorcycling. The drivetrain freeplay is not noticeable at highway speeds but around town it's a definite impediment to smooth progress. The motor's responsiveness and strong engine braking, while excellent attributes in themselves, make matters worse in this area.</p>
<p>On the incidentals side both bikes rate the usual pluses and minuses. The Suzuki's headlight is good but the low wattage bulbs (45/35W) mean the twin unit doesn't match the brilliance of the CNX750F Honda's duals, and the Yamaha's headlight is bright enough but penetration on high beam is disappointing.</p>
<p>The white-faced instruments on the GSX are a pain to read, especially at night, and it's surprising that Suzuki hasn't seen fit to include an oil temperature gauge. The air-cooled GSX750 ESD/EFE had one, and it would seem more sensible to include this useful instrument on an oil-cooled bike. The RZ-styled instruments on the FZ are bigger, easier to read and the speedo is less optimistic. Yamaha's idiots are larger and easier to see as well.</p>
<h1>Fiddling</h1>
<p>Switchgear is an area where Yamahas generally excel and the FZ is no exception. Auto-cancel indicators with the push overide are excellent and generally the layout of the left switchblock is great. Suzuki has taken a step in the right direction by throwing the combination switch into the trash can but has then stuffed it up by locating the horn control above the indicator switch, which is in any case sited too low on the switchblock.</p>
<p>The Suzuki's throttle is also much heavier. The horns are equally dismal, and the mirrors on the FZ are not too good either. The Suzuki's mirrors are acceptable. Stands rate from excellent on the FZ to poor on the GSX-R, which in keeping with tradition doesn't have a centrestand and is blessed with only a small-footed sidestand.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations the sporster-styled Suzuki has the better seat. It's not as plush as the FZ's seat but the greater width ensures you don't become too numb after a few hundred kilometres in the saddle. However as far as passenger suitability goes the FZ is superior. The Suzuki's alloy footpegs weren't popular and the join in the seat was equally annoying, for affectionate passengers anyway. One FZ feature that deserves comment is the choke control and reserve switch set in the left side of the fairing - very convenient!</p>
<h1>The result</h1>
<p>At the end of an all too brief association (six months would have been nice) with the dynamic duo it was impossible to make a decision on which was the better bike. This is by no means a cop out, but rather a recognition of priorities. A rider who prefers an out-and-out sportster will find the GSX-R totally satisfying, while a rider who has a liking for midrange power and isn't too fussed about a racer crouch will enjoy the FZ. Neither bike is perfect - the GSX-R suffers from excessive head-shaking over bumps during very brisk acceleration and the FZ is plagued with transmission slop. But then again that's a small price to pay for all that performance and generally impeccable handling. The best 750s yet? You bet!</p>
