<p><b>Triple Treat Or, proof that big cubic capacities aren't necessary prerequisites for great sports motorcycles. We put Yamaha's RZ350R, Suzuki's GSX-R400 and Honda's VF500F through the mill and discovered that things in middleweight land have never been better.</b></p>
<p>In our line of toil we ride bikes of all shapes, sizes, colours, religions and sexes, and since we're non sexist, non sectarian and often nonsensical we generally don't discriminate on these grounds or any other. On occasion there's a bit of "cc snobbery" going around the office but this is kept to a controllable minimum by the constraints of objectivity required in road tests. In other word the imminent arrival of a test bike engenders reactions quite independent of the aforementioned qualities. We can get just as excited about 250s as we do about 1100s, and likewise can be just as indifferent to the prospect of a big bore or little tiddler. Having said all this, there is one class that does prompt a predictable and favourable response - the middleweight sportsters. with a line-up like the GSX-R400 Suzuki, the VF500F Honda and Yamaha's new RZ350R a great time was guaranteed for all. This is what the middleweights have traditionally supplied: more grins per kilometer than any other capacity class. Nowadays this is done with finesse and refinement at least equal to and often surpassing a lot of larger capacity bikes - as you will see.</p>
<p>Styling-wise, the bikes make no bones as to which road they're on. All are equipped with up-to-date sportster prerequisites: sleek go-fast lines, flash paintwork, and racy frame-mounted fairings. The particular styling emphasis differs quite substantially among the three. The GSX-R is unashamedly designed in the endurance racer mould and looks extremely lithe and light. Suzuki took the slimming tool to the bike's predecessor (the GSX400FWD) with great gusto and the evidence of the company's seriousness becomes very obvious on closer inspection. The steel frame has been replaced by an alloy structure, and weight has been shaved from the motor, wheels, brakes, exhaust system and just about every other component. Just look at the enormous cut-out in the rear sprocket and the pillion peg brackets. Suzuki's perseverence has certainly paid off. The FWD weighed in at 187 kg dry; the R is down to 157 kg. That's a reduction of around 16 percent!</p>
<p>Compared to the GWSX, the other four-stroke in the comparo could come off the scales with the "fat boy" label. At 184 kg the VF is substantially heavier, but considered against most other bikes in the same performance and capacity bracket the VF could not be called heavy. Suzuki's 550 and Yamaha's XJ600 are both porkier, the XJ by 4 kg and the GSX by 12 kg. Unlike Suzuki, Honda obviously didn't have weight reduction as the number one priority, and this gives a clue to the VF's different nature. The bike is intended to be a sports/tourer with less of a sportster bias than the other two.
<p>It's the "softess" sportster in the comparo and neither looks nor behaves with the one-eyed racer spirit of the Suzuki.</p>
 <p>Not unexpectantly, the lightest of the bunch is the RZ, but the margin is much less than you might think. Despite the inherent advantage of a far lighter motor the RZ is only 9 kg slimmer than the GSX. In fact the new RZ-R has put on an extra 3 kg due to the RZ500-style full fairing.</p>
 <p>Surpisingly, the new 350 hasn't been treated to the same generous revamp as the 250. Unlike smaller brother, it hasn't received a power boost and changes from '84 have been almost entirely cosmetic. Apart from the variably-damped forks, a fork brace and new front calipers, the alterations have centred on the fairing, indicators, instrumentation and the replacement of the one-piece steel handlebars with the more fashionable alloy clip-ons. Apparently Yamaha felt that since the 350 class isn't as important as the 250 it wasn't worth the time and expense needed to squeeze more power from the middleweight stroker. Whether or not the 350 actually needs more power is debatable.</p>
 <p>If the styling and relative emphasis on lightness of each member of the trio isn't enough to indicate which is the sportiest then a quick sit on each will add a bit more substance to the argument. The GSX-R feels (and is) the smallest and the riding position is a reasonably aggressive sportster lean dictated by rear set pegs and narrow low bars. It's not quite the wrist-punishing extreme of most Ducatis, but definitely a more go-fast stance than either the RZ or the VF. The VF's footpegs are set further forward and then you adopt an upright sports/tourer stance. The riding position of the Yamaha lies between the VF and GSX-R.</p>
 <p>Of great interest are the two big "P"s: Power and Performance. All three have a lot of both. The manufacturers claim 42.5 kW at 11000 rpm for the GSX, 43.5 kW at 9000 rpm for the RZ and 51.5 kW at 11500 for the VF. On the dyno these produced rear wheel maxima of 32.1 kW at 11000 rpm, 32.8 kW at 9000 rpm and 37.1 kW at 11500 rpm respectively.</p>
 <p>So it would seem that the Honda has the horsepower race well and truly won! Unfortunately, its greater weight means that this superiority doesn't extend to top end acceleration. The Yamaha has sprightier response at high engine speeds while the GSX and VF fight it out for a fairly close second.</p>
 <p>All-in-all the power delivery characteristics of the trio are quite different and a surprise may be in store for those of you who loathe two-strokes. The GSX-R was even peakier than the RZ, undoubtedly a consequence of a four-stroke design producing almost the same maximum power as a two-stroke of similar capacity.</p>
 <p>The VF is the most tractable with a reasonably strong bottom end, a bit of a midrange lull from 5000 to 7000 rpm and a moderate boost at 7500 rpm. On the other hand, the GSX-R has good power between 3000 and 5000 rpm, a big hole to 8000 rpm and then a big top end blast. Typically, the RZ's low rev power is quite flaccid and the midrange adequate, but surprisingly the spread of power across the top end is much better than the Suzuki. While the GSX-R's power increases quite sharply from 8000 rpm (like the RZ's does from 6000 rpm) the two-stroke's output increases faster and levels off sooner while the four-stroke drops off more sharply on both sides of the maximum at 11000 rpm. This difference was particularly noticeable riding through the favourite twisty road, where the RZ had more drive out of corners. The rider on the Suzuki had to do the proverbial tap dance on the gear lever to keep the RZ in sight. Of course in this territory the Honda's predictable punch out of corners was better than both others.</p>
 <p>Occasionally seat-of-the pants impressions of power delivery can be a little off cue, so we lined up the trio for some roll-ons. While rolling away we saw a beaut example of roadside bureaucracy at work. The area used for the roll-ons was a stretch of fairly straight road which had, on that very day, been painted with brand-spankers yellow centre lines, guarded by witches hats. Now, three bikes side-by-side to take up most of the lane and a foot (mine) accidently contacted a witches hat and sent said object across to the other side of the road. The DMR must think that such wanton acts which destroy the symmetry of its carefully laid out pattern deserve some retribution. Never have we seen someone rush for the notebook with such speed. Wonder what cruel penalty there is for such a dastardly act?</p>
 <p>Apart from illustrating the speed at whichthe DMR employees could reach for the pen, and his incredible exaggerated writing movements (designed no doubt to scare us into submission) we did find out a few more relevant facts about the bikes' performance.</p>
 <p>In top gear from 60 km/h the RZ is left floundering, while the GSX-R initially bounds forward then to be quickly overtaken by the VF. From 80 km/h this scenario is repeated, the Suzuki getting the jump initially but soon losing the advantage to the Honda while the Yamaha is left behind. From higher speeds the Yamaha starts to get its act together. A roll-on contest from 100 km/h sees the VF stride off, with bothe the GSX-R and RZ fighting out the rear guard action. repeating the exercise at 120 km/h sees the RZ and VF evenly matched up front with the GSX-R trailing. From 140 km/h the RZ accelerates away never to be headed, with the GSX-R just starting to get the edge over the VF.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately a suitable dragstrip is still not available so we couldn't run the bikes over the standing quarter. On past results the GSX-R and RZ turned in times of 12.8 and 13.2 seconds respectively, the Yamaha losing out to the tune of 0.4 seconds because its lighter weight and broader spread of top end power couldn't compensate for the taller gearing and greater difficulty in keeping the front wheel down to a respectable height off the line. We've yet to try a VF on the strip but it should gain about 0.3 seconds at the strat over the GSX-R and be even-stevens for the remainder of the run. This would give the VF 12.5 secs at 167 km/h, the GSX-R 12.8 secs at 165 km/h and the RZ 13.1 secs at 169 km/h. - quicker and faster than the '84 model because of the more aerodynamic front profile.</p>
 <h1>Two-strokes rule</h1>
 <p>Those stading start confrontations are a lot of fun, but in some cases they don't tell the whole stroy about a bike's on-road acceleration. In the more relevant rolling start "gentleman's" drags from 50 km/h in first gear up to 160 km/h the standing quarter order was exactly reversed. The RZ took the honours by about four bike lengths from the GSX-R with the VF sitting right on the tail of the other four stroke.</p>
 <p>Top speed runs gave the RZ the victory laurels again. Its top speed of 198 km/h was quickly attained by redlining through the gears. The Suzuki responded to similar treatment almost as quickly to peak at 195 km/h. On the other hand the VF seemed to struggle past 180 km/h, but perseverence will produce a top of 192 km/h.</p>
 <p>So there you have it - a veritable arsenal of bloody fast weaponry. While the RZ is undeniably top of the heap the others are by no means slugs. No rider with good control of his or her faculties would not be satisfied with the performance of the four-strokes.</p>
 <p>The sources of this scintillating performance each has quite distinctive character. At one extreme there's the frenetic, busy free-revving GSX-R, at the other the smooth relaxed VF. Standing apart is the RZ with that beautiful 'stroker wail.</p>
 <p>Really. the fact that both the Suzuki and Honda have four cylinders is incidental. There's absolutely no similarity in engine character. The GSX-R's motor spins out extremely freely and drops the revs very quickly on throttling off to give excellent engine braking. But it always sounds as if the multitude of little components are working hard. At high revs the engine is noisy, and most tines a rider is aware of some vibration' it's not annoying but it's there.</p>
 <p>The Honda is completely different. Even at redline revs the motor doesn't sound or feel like it's in for hard labour, but has that smooth loping surge that is so typical (and delightful) of all Honda V-fours. If you're accustomed to riding an in-line four the VF's lack of buzz and the unusual firing pattern gives the illusion that the motor is spinning over much slower than it actually is. Consequently, the VF is deceptively fast and a glance at the tacho and speedo reveals that both needles are further towards naughty revs and speed than expected. It's a lovely little motor. Engine braking is excellent, but not quite up to GSX-R standard.</p>
 <p>Of course the Yamaha is different from either of the four-strokes but there is some similarity to the GSX. The motor spins out readily once the tacho reads 6000 rpm and although it doesn't feel or sound as buzzy as the Suzuki at similar engine speeds the motor doesn't have that relaxed VF character. Like the Suzuki there is a bit of buzz - a narrow band around 5000 rpm and another around 7000 rpm - but at engine speeds near redline the Yamaha is smoother. Again like the GSX-R the buzzing is most obvious on back-off, but unlike the in-line four this doesn't produce the same degree of deceleration. Engine braking is typically two-stroke poor.</p>
 <p>As we expect these days, starting is such a non-event that it's hardly worth talking about. It goes without saying that the modern bike (especially the Japanese variety) fires up just by glancing in its direction. Well, almost. The RZ very occasionally needed a second kick and the GSX-R was often a little reluctant to start from cold. Starting the VF was ridiculously easy. Choke wasn't necessary even on the coldest morning and the Honda burst into life the instant the button was pressed. The Honda didn't require any warming-up either, while the Suzuki needed a few minutes and the Yamaha a few more.</p>
 <h1>Fuel figures</h1>
 <p>Considering the GSX-R's high state of tune you would expect fuel economy to be quite disappointing. Not so. ridden with reasonable control of the right hand the Suzuki was quite frugal, (around 20 km/l) and a thorough thrashing would increase consumption to the high fifteens. It didn't seem to make much difference to consumption whether the bike was ridden moderately hard or extremely aggressively. On the other hand, the range in consumption of the VF and RZ in similar circumstances was much larger. If you hit the throttle hard fuel will disappear quickly (12.0 km/l RZ, 13.8 km/l VF) but if a little more restraint is shown the consumption will drop significantly - to the mid fifteens for the VF and around 13.5 km/l for the RZ. Both are thirstier than the GSX-R and not surprisingly the RZ is worst. At 20 litres, the RZ's tank is three and two litres larger than the VF's and GSX-R's respectively so this means on a run the Honda and Yamaha will both need to refuel somewhere around the 250 km mark while the Suzuki won't get desperate for another 60 kilometres.</p>
 <p>Apart from the two big Ps, the next most critical characteristic of a middleweight sportster is how it goes round corners and how it behaves at high speed. Well, the trio is certainly equipped for both tasks.</p>
 <p>ll have the fashionable double cradle frame with widely spaced lower members and upper rails following the outer edges of the tank and box-section swingarms. There are variations on the theme but the basic structures are quite similar. Notable differences involve the use of oval section tubing on the Yamaha, and rectangular section tubing on the VF and GSX-R. The Suzuki uses alloy throughout while Honda has stuck to the traditional steel. Both the Suzuki and Honda have removable lower sections to facilitate engine extraction.</p>
 <p>There's a lot less similarity in the front suspension systems used by the three manufacturers. Honda has opted for air assistance (unbalanced) and four-way adjustable TRAC antidive on the left leg, while the Suzuki forks are not air assisted but have a hydraulic antidive set-up. The Yamaha's forks have variable damping and air caps atop each leg. All three have fork braces.</p>
 <h1>Learn your names</h1>
 <p>Rear suspensions take the separate paths that each manufacturer has followed over the last few years with their rising rate monoshock systems. Suzuki uses the "Full Floater" which has a coil spring/oil-damped shock, a characteristic linkage system (both ends of the shock act through linkages) and the nifty remote hydraulic preload adjuster. Yamaha's "Monocross" has an oil damped/spring shock with five-way preload adjustable via a toothed rubber belt. Honda's "Prolink" utilises an adjustable air-spring set-up.</p>
 <p>Different systems, different performance. It was difficult to assess which was clearly superior, between the Honda and Suzuki at least. The VF and GSX-R forks were firmer and offered more controlled damping in the early and mid-stages of travel than the RZ's forks which were fairly soft and showed only a slight improvement in dive resistance over previous models, despite the fact that the new design has a variable damping capability. In other words while the VF and GSX-R forks refused to bottom out despite such harsh treatment as a fistful of brakes over bike-swallowing potholes the RZ was not so well served. The variable damping system is quite a simple one, merely depending on the size and location of damping channels. Unlike other units such as Kawasaki's AVDS or Suzuki's Posidamp (which both utilise valves in the damping circuitry) the action is entirely dependent on the quality of grade of oil in the forks. This would explain why the '85 RZ25oR's forks were a great improvement over '84 while the 350's weren't: the 350 was about 3000 km older. With fresh oil the forks would have been as impressive as the 250's.</p>
 <p>Rear suspension performance varied from reasonable to good but none of the rear units approached the excellence of others on such bikes as the RZ500, the GSX750 or GSX1100. Arguably the best was the "Full Floater" which offered the firmest ride but had the most controlled, progressive action. The "Prolink" seemed to have the traditional Honda problem - an inability to soak up small sharp-edged bumps - but otherwise was quite good. The "Monocross" was better than others over small ruts but was not as progressive as either towards the limits of its travel.</p>
 <p>No indaequacies in any of the suspension systems has led to any great handling problems. The three bikes all handle very well, even though each goes about the appointed task in a different fashion, and there is a best and worst in the bunch.</p>
 <p>Top by quite a margin is the GSX-R, a magnificent middleweight scratcher and possibly the best handling bike on the road at present. Most impressive was the rock steady high speed stability, unusable clearance (the best of the three) and neutral, light steering that doesn't develop a hint of vagueness at any speed. It's precision plus.</p>
  <p>As an important bonus the front end is not at all upset by big bumps at any speed despite the 16-inch front wheel. Even the Yamaha with the 18-inch front couldn't match the GSX-R's steadiness in the rough.</p>
  <p>Next on the list is the Yamaha. The two-stroke steers quickly and at moderately high speeds quite precisely. Stability at breakneck rate is better than the previous model but still not a match for the running-on-rails talent of the GSX-R. The Yamaha generally doesn't have that taut feel of the Suzuki, a quality which isn't aided by its significantly greater fork movement on braking and acceleration. Cornering clearance is not brilliant but certainly more than adequate for most riders.</p>
  <p>Without a doubt the VF500 is the best handler of Honda's family of V-fours. On smooth roads the VF has better high speed stability than the RZ and can be pushed around the sweepers with absolute confidence. However when the time comes for some nitty-gritty around your favourite bends the Honda's height, top heaviness and greater weight play some part in making it more dependent on brute muscle than the others. The Honda isn't as easy to flick from side to side or change direction midstream. But the bike is still great in winding territory, it's just that the other two are. Cornering clearance is on a par with the RZ.</p>
  <p>Much debate has raged of late about the worth or otherwise of 16-inch front wheels. It will surprise a few people to learn that the Suzuki with its smaller front wheel was superior to the 18-inch equipped Yamaha over the rough - at any speed. But that's how we found it - and the Honda wasn't too bad either. Certainly on occasions the VF's front end would get rather excited but this only happened at silly speeds and the bike only tended to do this when power was applied quickly and both front and rear suspension were working hard over a series of bumps. It seems the smaller hoops have a place on lightweight bikes.</p>
  <h1>Braking</h1>
  <p>Another critical requirement of the sporting connoisseur is a set of good stoppers and not one of this illustrious trio disappointed in this area, though again there are variations in style and quality.</p>
  <p>All the bikes have twin-disc front brakes and single rear discs, but different caliper designs are used by the different manufacturers.</p>
  <p>Honda uses dual piston floating calipers front and rear, the Suzuki has dual twin piston fixed calipers up front and twin piston fixed calipers on the small rear disc. The Yamaha is fitted with new dual piston fixed calipers on the front discs but the old style single piston floating caliper is retained at the rear. There's quite a mixture of style and a corresponding mixture of overall behaviour.</p>
  <p>In terms of power the GSX-R and RZ are extremely hard to seperate. It's easy enough to lift the rear end on both bikes by hefty applications of the front anchors on good surfaces so both have power to burn. On the other hand the VF couldn't match the excellent stopping distances of the two lightweights but that's not too surprising considering its additional bulk. It's all a matter of degrees though - while the RZ and GSX-R rate brilliant the VF is consigned to the dim, dark depths of excellence.</p>
  <p>In the other important area - feedback - the VF also runs lucky last but again it's a matter of degrees. More muscle is required and feel is not as good but the brakes are up their appointed task. It is possible however to induce some fade after arduous sessions of heavy usage. The RZ's stoppers need least muscle and provide more feedback front and rear while the GSX-R's brakes are a little heavier on the hand and foot and don't quite have the controllable feel of the RZ's brakes.</p>
  <p>Excellent stability under hars braking is the Suzuki's forte. due (in part at least) to the more efficient antidive the bike remains supremely controllable in any such situation. The Honda isn't too far behind but the Yamaha did disappoint somewhat with the tendency for the forks to bottom out over bumps under brakes.</p>
  <h1>A well-used component</h1>
  <p>On riding each of these sportsters it quickly becomes obvious that a busy left foot is an absolute necessity if rapid progress over the hills and dales is to be sustained. Consequently it would be a bit grim if the transmission systems were not up to a high standard.</p>
  <p>There's a few minor complaints but generally the transmissions are top class. Smoothest shifter is the GSX-R with the traditional short, light and positive change action and that's a relief since its gearbox sees the most use. By comparison the RZ's action is almost as light but not as positive while the VF needs more effort than either and is least precise of the three.</p>
  <p>No complaints of great consequence about the clutches. The hydraulic set-up on the VF is typically smooth with a narrow take-up while the RZ and GSX-R units are very easy on the left hand and there's a sufficiently wide take-up band to allow easy starts every time. The clutch lever on the GSX-R may be a bit of stretch for a small-handed person.</p>
  <p>So far, most of the emphasis has been on the sporting prowess of the trio but to varying degrees each bike is capable in other areas. For instance, the VF is an extremely good middleweight tourer. The seat is plush and the relaxed power delivery, lack of vibration, and casual riding position give the bike a few big pluses for long distance work. It's also the most suitable passenger carrier of the three.</p>
  <p>The Yamaha is more versatile as the wider seat gives the rider and pasenger more comfort and more room than the GSX-R's, and there's slightly less need for constant gear-swapping solo or two-up.</p>
  <p>Around town, all the bikes are quite useful mainly because their lightness and quick steering encourage effortless manoeuvring and easy passage through the traffic. Admittedly for brisk acceleration a rider will need to stick with the lower gears but that's not much of a hassle really. The order of merit is predictably Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki.</p>
  <p>Although the bikes are what's considered half size (or less) in capacity they have all scored the full complement or refinements quality of finish. The Suzuki had gathered a few blemishes over its 10000 or so kilometers but ignoring these imperfections it was easy to see that finish quality on all three is tops.</p>
  <h1>Moans</h1>
  <p>We've yet to discover the perfect bike, let alone a perfect threesome. (Come to think of it I have discovered a perfect threesome but we won't go into that.) The GSX-R scores a black mark for its dull idiots, small awkward fuel tap, the archaic switch, the silly sidestand which is too long with a horribly narrow foot, the lack of centrestand, and something we've moaned severely about before - that bloody rev limiter 200 rpm past redline. And there's one more. Someone in the design department must still be laughing. You see, there's a screw forming part of the spinning mechanism for the right sidecover. If you need the toolkit you'll have to remove the right sidecover, but then if you want to remove the right sidecover you'll need the toolkit! Catch 22 has been read by someone in the Suzuki factory! It's not really that bad; a coin can be used to removed the offending screw. But it is rather funny.</p>
  <p>The Yamaha scores the worst mirrors and the dumb (but usual) ignition switch layout: one click further than lock the parking lights go. It should be the other way around. The VF's only black mark involved the difficulty of using the pass light. The mirror stalks run so close the switch that it's hard to fit a gloved finger into the gap with any speed. The other bicth is so predictable it's boring. All the horns are miserable. RZs used to have a pair but the R has lost one through the dictates of styling. Perhaps instead of worrying so much about exhaust noise the powers that be should look into decibel outputs from most bike horns. Probably wouldn't be enough to move the sound-meter needle.</p>
  <p>On the positive side the GSX-R scores full marks for its twin headlights (which could be improved further by replacing the 35/35 W bulbs with higher wattage items), the Honda gets a merit badge for the large accessible fuel tap, layout of the left switch block, the push-to-cancel indicator switch and the press button high/low beam control. The Yamaha deserves special mention for left switch block (not as good as Honda's but a lot better than some), the excellent stands and large legible instruments.</p>
  <h1>The results</h1>
  <p>Now, each of the contenders in this middleweight field is marketed as a sportster, and if the best sportster is to be chosen then there's no argument. The GSX-R is the one. It looks, feels and behaves with supreme efficiency in that field. Zoom in the top end, a peaky power delivery, brilliant handling and excellent balance put the Suzuki right at the top of the sportster pile. But sneaking up behind is the RZ. Faster, punchier at high revs and easier to keep on the boil, the Yamaha isn't too far behind in the handling stakes and a good rider aboard the two-stroke will most likely keep the GSX-R very honest through the tight stuff because of the superior drive out of corners. At around $3200 the RZ is $500 cheaper and is better value for money. The Honda, at a similar cost to the Suzuki, is a different kettle of fish. It's not a narrow spectrum sportster in the GSX-R or RZ mould, but is extremely capable in that field and is a better town bike and tourer than both. If competence in every sphere is your fancy then the Honda should be the choice.</p>
  <p>It may seem like we've indulged in a bit of bet hedging but it really depends on what you want from a bike. The GSX-R is definitely the better sportster, the RZ is more fun and better value for money, and the VF is best jack of all trades. Take your pick.</p>
