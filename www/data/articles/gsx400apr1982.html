<p><b>Is the age of the twin over?</b></p>
<p><b>There's a law in physics which, roughly translated mechanically, says that every time you extract an advantage at one point you're paying for it somewhere else. It must have been forgotten when Suzuki put its Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber technology into its mid-range four. Without being at all unconventional, the bike handles pretty well, pulls with twins but powers out to RD-equalling performance, and also offers good economy! And it won't even empty your wallet to buy one.</b></p>
<p>Since the ill-timed end of Honda's much-loved CB400 four in 1976, the 350-400cc class has been dominated by twins - two or four-stroke; take your choice. Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki all built four-strokes which began life at 400cc. Yamaha also catered for the boy-racer set with its potent RD350 and 400 air-cooled two-strokes, forerunners of today's fast, water-cooled, monoshock RD350LC. Kawasaki persevered with a 400cc smoker triple for a period, but although the model was sweet to ride and very fast, peakiness and fuel thirst weighed against it in buyers' minds.</p>
<p>So the "Age of the Twin" has prevailed in the 400cc class from around '76. Fairly predictable in retrospect, although there was always a "just around the corner" Four. Less expected was Yamaha's continued refinement of its oil-burners. Significantly better performance and handling and very snappy looks have developed the RDs at the expense of alternative four-stroke models. in fact buyers of cleaner, more economical four-strokes got relatively less and less performance for their money.</p>
<p>lively 400cc four-stroke and began applying its Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber technology to this end. To come close to RD350LC performance four cylinders were essential (even with TSCC heads) and rolling weight had to be kept to an absolute minimum. Handling, suspension and steering would have to be first rate, not only to match the racey Yamaha, but because so many riders have fond memories of Honda's 400 four and would expect a five years-on better bike!</p>
<p>So Suzuki's four-stroke RD350LC - the GSX400F - is on sale now for $100 less than the RD's pricetag. In some ways it is better than the giant killer two-stroke and in others it's not. The new 400 four is, however, a worthy challenger in a very hotly contested market sector.</p>
<h1>Just basics - but good!</h1>
<p>Suzuki designed the GSX400 expressly for speed and after dyno and dragstrip testing the end product, we can vouch for its get-up-and-go. The little TSCC four screams out enough guts to easily hose off all 400-450cc twins including Suzuki's own GS450, no slouch in its own right. The little flyer matched Honda's eight-valve CX500 twin over the standing 400m and in doing so put under its belt Triumph's 750 Bonneville, Laverda's eight-valve 500 twin, Yamaha's SR500 Single, BMW's R80G/S dual purpose bike and Harley's 1340 Sturgis.</p>
<p>Match racing the GSX400 against Yamaha's liquid-cooled 350 on the road showed the Suzuki to be giving away very little, if anything, to the RD in acceleration provided the GSX's rider used the close ratio, six-speed gearbox to keep the free spinning four turning on the high side of 8000 rpm (the RD was being stirred along on the gearlever at its limit too, mind you). At Castlereagh the two-stroke held the GSX400 by a scant 0.1 seconds and three km/h in terminal speed. Certainly the new four's performance is quick enough to keep the RD honest. And it doesn't drink fuel like the potent RDs do although our test GSX400 was never as miserly with petrol as Suzuki's thrifty GS450 twin.</p>
<p>Suzuki has kept the new four's weight commendably low - at 179kg it is only four kilogrammes heavier than the GS450 twin. Perhaps more importantly the 400 feels light to sit on and light to ride. Nonetheless, Yamaha's RD350LC feels lighter again and boasts a dry weight of only 143kg.</p>
<p>A moderate seat height (780mm) and light, vice-free steering make the GSX and easy bike to ride while strong engine braking and powerful brakes take the desperation out of scrubbing off excess speed. The only restriction on the bike's ability to forgive rider error is the limited cornering clearance available - it's not bad but the Honda Hawks and Yamaha RD350 allow significantly greater lean angles before touchdown. We also found the standard IRC tyres grip well in the dry and fairly well in the wet, a change from the Yokohamas fitted stock to the RD350LC although the rim widths of Suzuki's star-spoked wheels are (as usual) too small, particularly at the rear.</p>
<p>The GSX400's styling lies somewhere between the radical Katana look and mediocrity, meaning rider comfort still exists, but the bike looks distinctive. Ours was finished in a stunning bright blue with silver detailing, and the four-cylinder powerplant gives the mid-sized GSX "big-bike looks" without the accompanying big-bike drawbacks of too much width, height and weight.</p>
<p>Niceties include a halogen headlamp (albeit of small diameter), a reasonably loud single horn, a fuel gauge (though, like all Suzukis, it makes a terrific road slope or lean angle indicator and sometimes gives the rider a rough idea of the petrol left in the tank), a digital gear indicator which is actually useful on this bike with its six close gears, and a steering lock in the ignition switch. We would have liked to have seen cancelling blinkers and a choke lever on the handlebars but apparently $1999 only goes so far. So you don't get a pillion grabrail or a rubber dirt cover for the lever end of the clutch cable either, even though the levers themselves are nicely dog-legged for comfort.</p>
<p>In terms of frame and suspension the GSX400 is conventional - no monoshocks, no adjustments other than spring preload and nothing outstanding in the way the components combine to work. The UK version of the bike scores a disc rear brake in lieu of the leading/trailing drum fitted to Australian models (we have no complaints about the drum) and a black-chromed exhaust set-up, but these alterations are nothing to get excited about. One could become a little excited over the seat, which is the best TWO WHEELS has encountered to date on a 400, and the ride comfort, which is also very good (but not up to one-litre bike standards) thanks to carefully-chosen spring rates. And the GSX400 is exciting to ride, primarily because it is one very fast 400.</p>
<h1>Free-spinning economy</h1>
<p>The double-overhead-cam, 16-valve four follows the pattern Suzuki adopted for the GSX750 powerplant - plain bearing lower end, one-piece crank, low dome pistons and narrow-included-valve-angle TSCC heads. Gears transmit the engine's power to the clutch and an automatically-tensioned chain drives the two camshafts. Lubrication is wet sump with no oil cooler (a la GSX750).</p>
<p>Each pair of exhaust or inlet valves in a combustion chamber is operated by a short split rocker with one follower. Valve clearance adjustment is free of shim headaches as each valve has its own screw adjuster on the rocker - fine fingers may be handy though; the familiar TSCC arrangement has been much reduced in size for the new four.</p>
<p>The engine's 398cc displacement comes from midly oversquare bore and stroke dimensions of 53 x 45.2mm. At redline and maximum power revs (10,000rpm) piston speed is a restrained 15.1m/sec, 25 percent less than many larger bikes' mean piston speed at peak revs. Compression ratio is high at 10.2:1 but our testbike could not be made to ping audibly on super no matter how badly it was laboured.</p>
<p>Fuel is metered by four constant vacuum Mikuni carbs of 26mm nominal bore, drawing air through an oiled foam element. Starting is electric only and ignition is electronic. Suzuki claims 30.6kW (41hp) at 10,000rpm as peak crankshaft power and 30.3NM at 8500rpm maximum torque, both of which look fair in view of our wheel test results. The claimed top speed of 178km/h is only slightly above our corrected top speed of 174km/h with the rider prone, and even the lower figure is excellent for a 400 (particularly a wide one). Yamaha's RD350LC managed 176km/h flat out, so once again the two are lineball.</p>
<p>The engine exhausts into a balanced four-into-two exhaust system which allows a surprising amount of motor growl out into the open, especially in the upper reaches of its revband. Don't get us wrong, there is no way the exhaust is excessively or illegally loud, it just allows a little more howl out up high than most Japanese exhausts. In fact it's actually an unintended safety plus - few things are more dangerous than a whisper-quiet high-powered motorcycle. All the same, Yamaha's throaty and revvy XJ550 four (an absolute honey of a bike if ever there was one) was dynoed immediately before the GSX400 and the Suzi was definitely slightly louder at high revs. It was noticeably louder mechanically too, in spite of its youth.</p>
<p>Unusually for a modern Oriental engine, the 400 was not an invariable first time starter from cold. Most times full choke or close to it was needed to get the four turning under its own power and some choke was necessary if the bike was ridden off without a couple of minutes warm-up. The 400 also tended to either stall or race excessively if left on its own to warm up on part choke. We feel a proper tune-up would have eliminated these problems and the mechanical noise mentioned earlier (bike had travelled only 2200km when we received it) going on previous experience with TSCC testbikes and our long-term test GSX750, but as it wasn't done before TWO WHEELS got the bike we can only surmise on the amount of improvement that would result.</p>
<p>Once the bike is warm and running nicely two characteristics of the engine are immediately apparent - it makes excellent low-rev power in the 2000 to 4500 rpm range and is very strong from 7500 rpm up into the red. Unfortunately there is little rise in power from 4500 rpm to about 7000 rpm so if the level of power available at 4500 isn't enough one must tap-dance the gear lever until the revs are brought up to at least 7500 rpm. The you just hang on and marvel at the pull to redline, change gear and marvel again.</p>
<p>The engine seems to have two distinct power zones separated by a rather dead mid-range which has to be spun through to get the little screamer to its potent top end (unless one is redlining every gear in which case the mid-range dullness is of no consequence). It is not uncommon in suburbia or when preparing to overtake a slow vehicle in the country to have to drop three gears to get the 400 singing. The multiplicity of changes can be annoying two-up or when the rider basically wants to cruise but must pass a truck first, but it is a price one must pay if the absolute ultimate in 400cc performance is essential.</p>
<p>The most comfortable crusing speed on a GSX400 is surprisingly high - an indicated 140 km/h or true 135 km/h which translates to about 8000 rpm in sixth. At this speed the bike storms up practically any hill with ease (drop back to fifth to maintain this speed two-up) and the irritating vibrations which creep through handlebars, tank footpegs and seat into the rider's and passenger's bodies at lower revs have dissolved into silky smoothness. The bike itself seems able to maintain 8000 rpm endlessly without strain.</p>
<p>But back to the vibration: Our testbike vibrated enough to mildly annoy between 3500 and 4500 rpm (frequently used engine speeds) and buzzed badly from 6000 rpm to just under 8000 rpm (7500 rpm without the vibes would be a nice cruising speed with the cams just on song and allowing the rider to use much less throttle than at 7000 rpm for the same response). The instrument binnacle cops a fair shaking in the lower buzz-zone and even the rubber-mounted mirrors blur badly between 6000 and 8000 rpm. We don't know if the problem was due to an isolated fault with our particular 400 or if vibes are a part of every GSX400, but Suzuki make far smoother 1000 cc fours than this 400 and Honda's old CB400 four was a sewing machine by comparison (the GSX though, will blow the doors off the old Honda in a straight line). We suggest you insist on a testride to check vibration before you buy one. There is no reason for any modern 400 four to be anything less than electric-motor smooth - Yamaha's XJ550 is far smoother in spite of its larger reciprocating masses.</p>
<p>There is one other important attribute of the 400's 16-valve mill - owners' contributions to the OPEC retirement fund will be much lower than RD350LC riders' donations. After the first fuel stop, when surprisingly little fuel was needed to return the tank to full, a close eye was kept on economy for the next 900 km of the test. The usual notes on types of riding between fill-ups were kept and the odometer was corected at Castlereagh (it was only 1.4 percent optimistic). Despite an inordinate amount of 8000-10,000 rpm work (partly to dodge the vibration) the overall average on test excluding strip and dyno fuel use was 19 km/l (54.1 mpg). Solo country touring in the 110-120 km/h range saw the bike return 25.7 km/l (73.1 mpg), an excellent result and a far cry from RD figures for similar use! Dragstrip testing raised consumption to 14.8 km/l (41.2 mpg) while solo cruising on level road at 100 km/h into a mild (say 5-6 km/h) headwind returned an outstanding 31.3 km/l (88.9 mpg), a figure precisely the same as an accompanying XL500 Honda single achieved. The other figures are given on the specifications pages but it is clear the GSX400, like its bigger TSCC brothers, is capable of excellent economy.</p>
<h1>Strips and dyno performance</h1>
<p>For a while at Castlereagh we thought the GSX might equal the RD350LC's best time of 13.9 seconds but it was not to be. We managed several runs in 14 seconds dead, but despite lots of attempts the GSX just couldn't take off the last tenth of a second to make the 13s. Terminal speed was 146 km/h and zero to 100 km/h took 6.6 seconds.</p>
<p>Thanks to its low first gear the 400 could be wheelspin started with 10,000 rpm on the tacho and the rider crouched well forward. Occasionally there would be some front wheel lifting but monos only assumed giant proportions if the revs were below 9000 when the clutch was dropped. Change-ups were made at 10,500 rpm and the well-chosen ratios ensured no let up of acceleration in the next gear. Running beyond 10,500 rpm produced a noticeable fall-off in power and slower times. The speedo read two percent high at 60 km/h and four percent high at 100 km/h and above. The clutch required a small freeplay adjustment at the end of the season but was otherwise unaffected.</p>
<p>The Stewart Car Company dyno showed the GSX400 engine to be more powerful than the liquid-cooled Yamaha 350 (it is 14 percent larger in displacement) by 3.2 kW (15 percent) but the extra herbs are used moving the 400's extra dead weight, around 30 kg if we allow six kilogrammes for the Yamaha's coolant and two-stroke oil, so the RD remains the class performance king - just! The loaded power-to-weight ratios of both bikes are as near as dammit identical.</p>
<p>Comparing the four's power curve with that of Suzuki's super-flexible GS450 twin yields one or two surprises. Firstly, the sporty four makes significantly more power in the 2000-4000 rpm range than the twin - we expected reasonable low-rev power but hadn't thought the 400 would be able to match the larger twin. This healthy bottom end grunt makes the four easy to ride at around town speeds although high revs are still needed to put the engine onto its next power plateau on the high side of 7500 rpm. Above 4500 rpm the 450 twin builds power steadily and evenly to its peak of 20.8 kW at 9000 rpm, whereas the four's power build-up eases right off for a couple of thousand revs before picking up again and heading for its peak of 24 kW at 10,000 rpm. This flat mid-range power zone gives the 3000 rpm sag in the torque curve. We also didn't expect the four to be fully 15 percent stronger in top end power than the larger twin.</p>
<p>The four's good showing in the 2000-4500 rpm zone makes mincemeat of the RD350LC's performance at these revs although the peaky two-stroke really cracks it on from 6000 to 9000 rpm. The GSX400's dyno performance is very close to a proportionately downscaled replica of Yamaha's equally-spirited XJ550 four. The XJ is 38 percent larger in capacity and its rear wheel power is very close to being 25 percent greater throughout the rev range, except that it has slightly less of a levelling off of power gain at mid-range revs. Its larger available power also makes this phenomenon less noticeable on the road. At no time did the Suzuki give any indication of overheating or other unwelcome stress during the test.</p>
<p>When we first picked up the GSX400 it was reluctant to properly select neutral when hot and changes were clunkier than we like. After we reset the clutch cable freeplay these operations improved although swapping gears remained a fairly notchy procedure when the motor was hot. The linkage is positive - we never found an unwanted neutral - and the internal ratios are well suited to the engine. Drivetrain freeplay is par for the course and poses no problems. Overall gearing too is excellent, the engine turning 10,200 rpm at top speed.</p>
<h1>Handling, braking and detail</h1>
<p>The GSX400 is a good handler without being brilliant. It feels much better when riding hard than big-brother GSX750, but lacks the taunt, racey feel of an RD350LC or, for that matter, an XJ550. Steering is good and the GSX400 is extremely chuckable on the road (within the confines of its cornering clearance) and smooth roads can be traversed very quickly. Throw in a few mid-corner bumps and dips and the 400 begins to move around beneath the rider. The bike never reaches a genuine wobble, headshake or weave, but on an average road an RD will be significantly faster because of its lean clearance and feel more precise and stable as well.</p>
<p>The GSX's suspension units do a reasonable job on lousey surfaces although the forks have only average travel and the conventional rear end's performance is well below that of the Yamaha's monoshock rear suspension. Generally, the Suzuki acquits itsel well against the more agricultural circa-400 cc twins but the Honda 400 Super Hawk is a sweeter handler and more fun to push through corners.</p>
<p>The Suzuki was untroubled by mid-corner braking and handled two-up riding well even if lean clearances did take a further beating. Dirt roads too, were well coped with.</p>
<p>Both the airy-looking, light weight, twin-disc stopper for the front wheel and the somewhat down-market drum brake on the back wheel worked entirely satisfactorily on test. Only gross abuse would make the rear brake fade (and then it recovered quickly) and the front discs were powerful and predictable wet or dry. One small area which could be slightly improved is the feel in the front brake during light applications - the bigger Suzuki's are a little better in this regard, needing slightly less lever pull to produce gentle retardation. The 400's brake produces plenty of feel in desperate situations however and the bike can be slowed very quickly and safely with good stability, albeit with plenty of nosedive.</p>
<p>One area in which the GSX400 shines is rider and passenger comfort. The riding position is a good compromise between super sports and touring, the suspension is well set up to absorb roadshock and the seat is exceptionally good for a 400 cc bike. It is definitely the most comfortable bike in its class, being well ahead of its 450 cc brother and Honda's 400N Hawk for example (the CX500 is better again, however).</p>
<p>Because of its low weight the bike is reasonably easy to manoeuvre and good steering geometry helps make steady riding at low speeds a quickly-learned art. Both stands are easy to use although the mainstand could be further refined. Mirrors, switches and controls were all easy to use after a two minute familiarity session; we liked the lever-type combined high/low beam and left/right blinker switch. Some controls (clutch) felt a trifle vague but cable lubrication would probably remedy this.</p>
<p>Instruments were clear and reasonably accurate (save the fuel gauge) and were night-illuminated with Suzuki's usual dull pink lighting - no complaints here. The sophisticated four cylinder engine will require more time for a tune-up than the average twin, but service needs should be no more frequent. And its meagre petrol thirst allows a reasonable touring range to be extracted from each 15 litre tankful (reserve is 3.5 litres).</p>
<p>We feel the tank's a touch wider at the rear than it need be and tends to push the rider's knees outwards into the breeze more than necessary. The underseat rear pouch is pretty small and we really find a hinged seat much easier to live with than the current bunch of bolt-down specials. We have no major bitches with the 400 however.</p>
<p>The GSX400 is a curious mix - the engine is pure sports/racer, the comfort and fuel consumption are of tourer standard and the handling falls somewhere between the two. Let's hope the vibrations we quickly came to hate were a peculiarity of our test bike, if so a lot of buyers may find the new Suzuki to their liking at $1999.</p>
<h1>A second test</h1>
<p>When we mentioned to Suzuki Australia our surprise at the amount of vibration, the company made available a new 400 to compare against the original test machine. So aboard an attractive, 105 km-old silver and orange GSX400 we set out to see if its vibration levels were any lower than our test bike's.</p>
<p>They were, but not by much and since most engines vibrate a lttle less during run-in than fully loose we think the silver beauty would end up only marginally smoother than the blue beauty in the 105-135 km/h cruising range (in top). Where the second bike did fare better was in the lower band of vibes, from 3500 to 4500 rpm. Here our original bike transmitted annoying tingles through the handlebars to riders' hands and even heavily-gloved hands became numb and tingly after a spell of riding at these dull revs (city riding). The second GSX was far better in this regard, bare hands could be used for half an hour with no discomfort and gloves provided enough isolation to kill all the low-rev handlebar harshness. Whether this situation would remain after 2000 km is only surmise, but we think the second machine would remain noticeably better than the first; period.</p>
<p>In conclusion, TWO WHEELS found the GSX400 annoyingly buzzy at the most commonly-used open road touring speeds (105-135 km/h) and a good deal less smooth than we think such a small four should be (and Honda's CB400 four was). The vibration can be lived with - the engine is very smooth over 8000 rpm and reasonable below 6000 rpm and Yamaha's RD350LC has its rough spots too - but some further work on vibration and harmonics by Suzuki engineers would be welcome before the next model is released. Maybe a rubber-mounted engine if all else fails.</p>
