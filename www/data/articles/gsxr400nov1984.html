<p><b>The prefix 'GSX-R' has taken on so much added meaning since Suzuki's newest 750 was anveiled at Cologne recently, that it would be natural if one prepared himself for a let-down when about to ride the GSX-R400. Instead of an oil-cooled Formula One replica, the 400 is, after all, little more than a hotted up, tarted over GSX400FWS - a machine which, when tested by AMCN earlier this year, proved to be a nice bike, but nothing to get the adrenalin surging.</b></p>
<p><b>However, in reality, the GSX-R400 is more than its immediate heritage would indicate and the thoroughly enjoyable nature of the bike makes it more than worthy of the GSX-R tag. Just ask Bob Maron ..</b></p>
<p>Like most people, I sat and salivated over photographs of Suzuki's GSX-R750 - the bike which seems more closely related to its racing counterpart than anything we've yet seen.</p>
<p>Also like most people, I'd sat and wondered over recent Suzuki advertisements which sang the praises of the then unreleased GSXR-400. I mean; how would it shape up?</p>
<p>400cc is a slightly odd capacity for bikes in Australia, but already we have seen bikes like the VF400 Honda and Suzuki's own GSX400FWS on showroom floors. Without wishing to denigrade those machines (they are both quite capable, even if pricey and a little bland in power delivery) it must be said that they lacked any real excitement - unless the technical complexity turned you on.</p>
<p>But the fact that 400cc could be a viable capacity class was brought home on the very first ride on this latest offerring. The GSX-R lacks nothing in excitement!</p>
<p>The reason for this astounding transformation from FWS model to GSX-R is simply that Formula 3 racing is a big thing in Japan - you may remember a recent news snippet relating the Croz's venture into the class. And Formula 3 is a down-size version of the Formual 1 class which caters to 750cc four-strokes and 500cc two-strokes. In other words, 400cc machines kitted out with high performance engines and all the racing bits.</p>
<p>To give you some idea of where the GSX-R fits in amomg the CBR400 Hondas and FZ400 Yamahas, it is worth noting that in a recent track evaluation of all three models at Sugo International raceway, the Suzuki came out on top with ameasured peak speed of 205.1kmh (fastest by 2.8kmh), a standing 400m of 12.21 seconds (quickest by .22 seconds) and a lap time of 1:21.74 (quickest by 1.56 seconds).
<p>Now, we can't vouch for the absolute accuracy of these figures - after all, we didn't conduct the testing - but one thing we can assure you is that the the GSX-R400 Suzuki is one helluva fast 400. So fast that it seriously challenges Yamaha's RZ500 - I kid you not.</p>
<p>Under the circumstance, it would be unreasonable to evaluate the bike as a shopping trolley or long distance tourer, though there are certainly bikes less suited to those tasks as well. What it is, is a race replica.</p>
<p>Starting with the FWS engine we saw at the end of last year, Suzuki has virtually redisgned every component and fitting, giving the liquid cooled four cylinder powerplant a solid boost in performance, taking horsepower out to 44kW - 110kW per litre or, in old terms, nearly 150bhp/litre! Torque is a reasonable 4kg-m most of which is produced close to peak power although, judging by the apparent power spread, there must be something of a minor peak at around 4000rpm as well.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that the power characteristics - a surge in the bottom end up to around 4000rpm, then a 'flat' area running to about 6500rpm and leading into the sweet spot which starts at about 7000 and runs right up to redline - tally up fairly closely with many warmed over street bikes, particularly those fitted with an effective, power boosting four-into-one exhaust system.</p>
<p>One glance underneath shows why: the GSX-R400 is fitted with just such a pipe, exciting the head in four beautifully curved arcs to enter a square layout collector under the sump which dumps into a large diamter pipe and muffler.</p>
<p>Any way, compare those power figures with Yamaha's RZ350: the Yammie has an identical peak power figure (and remember it's a stroker) of 44kW with a peak torque of 4.8kg-m. Yep, the stroker has more torque - and at lower revs, but because the GSX-R revs 2000rpm further than the RZ, it effectively has a broader spread of go-for-it urge.</p>
<p>But the increased performance compared with the FWS comes more from the massive reduction in weight and presumably, the better air penetration afforded by the R version's twin headlight fairing. Weighing in at 187kg dry, the FWS was no ultra-light, but the GSX-R most defintely is scaling in at a mere 157kg. And although the R is somewhat tall, airflow over the fibreglass is bound to be much smoother, therefore offering a much improved top speed - perhaps in the order of 5 to 10 kmh.</p>
<p>The weight reduction has come largely as a result of using alloy in the construction of the chassis. Whereas the FWS used box section steel, the R has a similar section alloy with the famed 'dimple' sides to provide additional torsional rigidity.</p>
<p>But that isn't the only change, the frame isn't simply a replica of the FWS unit manufactured in lighter materials; it's an entirely new unit. Minor steering head angle changes have brought the rake to 27.5 degrees compared to a previous 27.3 and trail remains the same at 96mm, but wheelsbase has been shortened by 10mm from 1435mm and instead of the comparatively simple spine arrangement in the backbone, the new frame has two widely spaced frame rails running back from the headstock and then plunging almost vertically to the cast-in swingarm pivot.</p>
<p>On the right side, the front downtube and lower rail bolts off for easier engine removal. The rear subframe also bolts into place so if you bend it, you can at least replace that section alone rather than the whole lot (small consolation, really).</p>
<p>The original style of Full Floater rear suspension is still in use - that is, the system which has the shock compressed from both ends rather than the much simplified system which has the upper end mounted solidly to the chassis and only the lower end acted upon through linkages by the swingarm itself. The latter system is part of a rationalisation steadily bringing all the Japanese into line.</p>
<p>Up front, the forks are quite conventional Suzuki, with a hydraulically activated anti-dive taking pressure from the brake system to restrict the compression damping orifice and therefore allow the forks to 'pump up' slightly when weight is transferred to the nose. Reasonably efficient, but nothing startling these days.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Suzuki has maintained the bike's nimbleness through the use of very light looking cast wheels - a 16-inch front and an 18-inch rear. But unlike many recent 16-inchers, the GSX-R has tyre sizes (100/90-16 and 110/90-18) which aren't excessively wide, meaning that longitudinal ridges and off-centre bumps won't push the wheel around so much and steering characteristics can be kept comparatively neutral with relative ease.</p>

<p>On the braking front, Suzuki has used two four-spot calipes up front and a conventional opposed piston unit at the rear giving a total of ten live pistons - that's a lot of braking for a 157kg bike! Feel from the system is also quite good and the lever pressure required to stop quickly can be easily modulated though it's not quite as powerful as some (but then some are too powerful). The only 'complaint' I could level at the braking system would be that the rear anchor lacked sufficient feel - largely because the bike weighs so little it's incredibly easy to unload the rear end when stopping quickly and have the tyre skittering - we've had the rear end right off the deck, a trick usually restricted to two-strokes or bloody good riders! Some of this is because of what appears to be a comparatively high centre of gravity.</p>
<p>Cosmetically, the machine has been endowed with the full 'formula racer' look and, believe me, it looks much better in the flesh than it does in any of the advertisingshots I've seen so far. In those, the fairing looks wide and somehow poorly proportioned, but in reality it is quite slim with only the handlebar flares edging at all wide and they do so for a purpose. Maybe I'm a cynic, but in the past I've always considered these as little more than an odd quirk of the man responsible for styling (except on the track where narrower handlebars are used). These ones though actually protect your hands from most of the wind blast, diverting the slipstream over and around the bars - good one.</p>
<p>Similarly, the fairing screen comes up high enough to give some chest protection, though it's by no means a full weather protection unit and seems more designed for its wind cheating capabilities than comfort.</p>
<p>The fuel tank, sculpted in quite an angular style, sits on top of, rather than around, the frame rails with the fuel petcock attached to the left rail just in front of the rider's knee. The tap itself is perhaps a little too small, making it more difficult than necessary to switch over to reserve when required.</p>
<p>As soon as you sit on the bike, you are struck by the similarity between the instruments of the GSX-R and those on the RG250 - both bikes have rubber mounted pods hung inside a black panel, offering speedo, tacho and temperature gauge. However, the RG doesn't have instruments which read to 220kmh and are red-lined at 12000rpm!</p>
<p>And don't make the mistake of thinking that Suzuki's optimism is surpassed only by it's audacity! This bike will spin its tacho needle right into the red zone where the only thing that stops it from going further is the rev limiter. The speedo needle will easily see 190kmh and 200kmh (indicated) is within reach on a long stretch of road.</p>
<p>One dissapointing aspect of the electrical system is that in spite of having twin headlamps, illumination at night is nothing startling. Don't misunderstand: these lights are slightly brigher overall than a 55/60 watt single and give a better spread to the sides, but Suzuki hasn't taken the opportunity of fitting twin 55/60s - as did Honda with the CBX750. The bottom line is that lighting is good - better than average in fact - but not as good as it could so easily have been. Each light is only a 35/35 watt unit.</p>
<p>Before leaving the headlamps, it must be said that you at least have the opportunity of fitting that much more zap power with comparative ease.</p>
<p>In recent Suzuki tradition, the trafficator lights have been designed to fit flush with the bodywork - the front ones becoming the leading edge of the handlebar flares and the rear ones being inset into bulges at the sides of the tailpiece. Unfortunately the rear units have disappeared, courtessy ADRs, to be replaced by conventional stalk mounted ones.</p>
<p>If you're a stickler for details like myself, you won't like them. They are comparatively cheap looking and out of character with the rest of what is a superbly finished machine. The very least that should have been done is to fit the much more attractive trafficators from the rear of the GSX400FWS. But you can't have everything.</p>
<p>One more bitch before moving onto the good stuff (riding): the tail light is too small. It's bright and won't be readily missed, but because it's so small it tends to blend into the background traffic at night. In truth though, there are quite a number of bikes which suffer the same flaw and I feel almost guilty at singling out Suzuki's 400, but the comment is valid just the same.</p>
<p>Okay, so what's it like to punt around on?</p>
<p>Firing the four-valve engine into life is, as expected, extremely easy. One press of the starte and she bursts into life - as long as you use the choke (more than half) when cool or cold. The fast idle arrangement deserves a little criticism though because it was extremely difficult to get the bike running at a reasonable speed while donning gloves and helmet and generally waiting for the bike to warm up.
<p>Unless careful, the engine bursts into life with about 5000rpm on the tacho - not good for a cold engine - and then, after only a few moments, dies to almost nothing. At no time during the test could I get the engine to run for more than a few seconds on choke, meaning that after the initial burst I had to switch the choke off and carefully blip the throttle a few times before standing back nervously with the engine turning over at only a couple of hundred revs.</p>
<p>That minor inconvenience overcome, the bike was quite happy to be ridden inside a minute or two, though plain bearing engines such as this really require more thorough warming to enable oil to work its way between the bearing surfaces.</p>
<p>The gearbox is a six speed job, geared quite low to take full advantage of the 12000rpm redline, and performed quite well except for some notchiness which never seemed to completely clear up. The clutch also deserves praise, but had the habit of sticking quite badly when cold and needed to be freed up with a few clutch-in throttle blips before selecting first gear in the morning. Otherwise the clutch gave sterling service, responding strongly no matter what abuse was handed out.</p>
<p>For the first part of the test we were restricted in engine speed in order to ensure a proper running in period, and with the tacho only calibrated down to 3000rpm, we quite often found ourselves cruising about town with the needle resting on its stop. For such a light bike, bottom end power is quite adequate, particularly when you consider how much urge the engine hides up higher.</p>
<p>Once we could start to rev the engine out, it became apparent that there is something of a 'hole' in the mid-range. From around 4500rpm to just above 6000rpm engine response flattens out and even full throttle rewards the rider with only sluggish acceleration. But sweep beyond 7000rpm and things start to happen with increasing speed until at 8000rpm you're right in the hot stuff.</p>
<p>At that point, engine power can only be described as stunning and acceleration as incredible for a machine this size. The engine fairly snarls as the revs build to a blood-curdling scream with the tacho edging closer to the 12000rpm red-line - incredible!</p>
<p>On the other hand, stitching a path through slow traffic isn't too bad either. Using the stronger power below 4500rpm will easily see you through that task - just don't expect stump-pulling grunt.</p>
<p>As well as the usual hack work we put all our test bikes through, there were a couple of longer forays into the country and through the hills where the bike is more naturally in its environment. On flat roads in tight country the GSX-R is a sheer delight, changing direction quickly and predictably and handling constant, opening and tightening radius curves with equal facility.</p>
<p>And few people will ever have to worry about cornering clearance - the rearset alloy footpegs are high enough to stay off the deck until you throw it down the road and the use of a four-into-one exhaust means there aren't any pipes running along the bottom of the frame. I would estimate that you'll run out of tyre traction before anything comes remotely close to dragging around bends - certainly with the stock rubber.</p>
<p>On moderate to bumpy roads the bike behaves well, although the suspension is firmer than ideal for comfort. But then, this bike would appear to have been set up to emulate its race track cousin (the GSX400R) and doesn't have excessive wheel travel or a tour-plush ride. Even so the bike doesn't get out of shape and takes most bumps and potholes in its stride.</p>
<p>The only time the bike misbehaves at all is at medium speeds when a slight tendency to wander around some bumps rather than roll over the top is evident. This disappears with speed.</p>
<p>On really bad roads with large potholes, ridges and bigger bumps, the GSX-R400 just becomes too uncomfortable for sustained high speed riding. Again, it must be stressed that the bike doesn't do anything wrong, it just transfers too much of the shock to your backside and hands, making it difficult to stay smooth - an attribute we also commentated on with the superb handling GPz900R Kawasaki.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the bike is capable of speeds close to (if not in excess of) 200kmh, and at that speed, rock-steady stability is vitally important - a point manufacturers of many larger bikes should take more notice of. In the 400 Suzuki's case, stability was close to perfection right to peak speed with only a slight vagueness creeping in at the extreme.</p>
<p>That vagueness could even be put down to minor innacuracies of wheel alignment, but the probable cause is that Suzuki has gone a touch too light on the rear end damping.</p>
<p>That raises another thing: when the GSX750ESD first arrived, it had hydraulic pre-load adjustment at the rear as well as a four-position rebound damper knob. For some reason (presumably cost) that damper knob hasn't been transferred throughout the company's range. It seems a shame because that fitting would enable you to compensate for wear and also to dial in the ride that best suits you.</p>
<p>In any case, the 400 doesn't have the extra nick-nack when, if any Suzuki would be suited to such a thing, this is it. In fact suspension adjustment is limited to just the pre-load dial at the back (located on the left side where it can be got at even while riding). Up front you take the forks as they come - no damping or pre-load adjustment at all - but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. In this case, the forks work quite well and didn't seem to need any changes whether one-up or two-up, travelling fast or picking through traffic.</p>
<p>Creature comfort isn't compomised greatly either considering the machine's design role. In fact there a few broader spectrum bikes I could name which don't have as good a seat. The GSX-R400's seat is not brilliant, but the shape and firmness of the padding mean you can stay on it for quite long periods (in excess of 200km) before the backside starts to numb.</p>
<p>Having a fairing keep most of the wind off your chest is another boon, but in this case there's just enough slipping by that your arms don't tire too quickly on the only moderately high handlebars.</p>
<p>The bars themselves lend the rider a forward lean which is sporting without being too tiring. Even around town leverage is quite good, though the turning circle feels comparatively large for a bike this size - steering is limited to 30 degrees either side of the centre.</p>
<p>Footpegs are set back, but not far enough to cramp your knees, even if you're taller than average. Suzuki has been more concious of this than most recently, and the result is excellent.</p>
<p>Pillions won't have it quite so good though. The rear half of the seat is raised a few inches and perches the passenger a long way from the ground. The footpeg location isn't bad - there's again plenty of room for legs, but with little to grab a hold of staying on the back when the rider gets going isn't always easy!</p>
<p>Grab rails run along either side under the bodywork but are a fair way back and not as easy to grip as they could be, but overall you won't find pillions complaining overly much - this no RZ500 Yamaha which was designed as a solo bike above all, relegating pillions to 'take it as she is or walk' status.</p>
<p>In fact, for such a high profile sportster, the GSX is remarkably versatile - not that I'd recommend it for those whose rdining is primarily tour or communiting oriented.</p>
<p>So who's going to buy it?</p>
<p>I can't confidently predict that Suzuki will have a flood of buyers pouring through showroom floors, but that isn't because the bike's not worthy of that much attention - it is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Australians still suffer from traces of the 'ya can't beat cubes' syndrome - an anachronism hung over from the sixties and seventies. And that is an enormous pity, because this bike is worthy of being stacked up against VF500s, XJ600s, GPz550s and even Suzuki's own GSX550. But most people will go for the bigger 550/600s simply because they are bigger.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure though; this 400 will easily outsell the two earlier attempts to put a machine of this capacity onto the market. Honda's VF400 and Suzuki's 400FWS were never destined for success here, but the GSX-R400 comes into the ring with a much better chance.</p>
<p>This 400 gives away little to the 600 class bikes in top speed, very little in acceleration and outdoes all of them in cornering prowness. As a real little hot- rod, this bike is top stuff.</p>
