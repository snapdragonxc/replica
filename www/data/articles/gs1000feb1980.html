<p><b>The constant one-bike-to-another trip - it occurs as a matter of course at TWO WHEELS - is essential for comparative values.
But our recent switch of Europe's best sporting superbike - Laverda's thundering 1000 Jota - for Japan's top machine - Suzuki GS1000S - ranked as the most telling switch ever. Here's why:</b></p>
<p>A rider - any rider - faced with the choice of Laverda Jota or GS1000S would have to rationlise that the Japanese product is the more practical, and hence most sensible machine of the two.</p>
<p>The progress to that conslusion is not easy - the quantity and strength of the intangibles are blinding. Logic pales even in the face of bald facts and figures as nowhere can the Laverda outdo the Japanese speedster even though there are several areas in which the GS outperforms the Jota.</p>
<p>And if the ageing parent who spluttered over his scotch needed further evidence of where world motorcycling is at while he watched on the Edinburgh Tatoo television coverage the famous Royal Artillery motorcyclist ride out on shiny Suzuki SP370s, then the GS1000S is it.</p>
<p>Not that the point hasn't been made by TWO WHEELS before. In last month's "Muscle Act" round-up of the 1000 cm3 superbikes product quality was oft-stressed: Perhaps bikes had peaked within the parameters of cost-efficient mass-production.</p>
<p>It's a right-on point to ponder in back-to-back GS/Jota considerations. The sharply differing philosophies behind Japanese and Italian musclebikes are spelt out here, as are labor-intensive "added character" costs.</p>
<p>One gets the impression Suzuki would never have built a 1000 without the intense competition of other factories, whereas for Laverda 1000 cm3 was essential. The Jota is mean and macho, the GS1000S is competent and nice.</p>
<p>Both bikes are bloody fast!</p>
<p>For many riders - this tester included - the Suzuki will seem bland compared with the soul-stirring Jota. The Laverda has so much character it practically redefines the word, but deciding to pay more than a grand extra to get the character (and Jota exclusivity) is quite another matter - particularly when there are other penalties (such as less comfort and little "tourability") attached to the Italian. Perhaps it's a pity the GS is as good as it is - the Laverda's impeccable high-speed handling can no longer be used to justify the extra bread riders wanting the Bologna-built Jota have to shell out.</p>
<h1>The bike</h1>
<p>Since TWO WHEELS' test of the original GS1000 tourer in September 1978 there have been several variants of the model. The H, E and N all incorporate small variations to suit particular sections of the market. Our test bike was a GS1000S, the latest packaging alternative for the 1000 and slanted towards the cafe racer type of bike buyer. The model is aimed directly at Kawasaki's highly successful Z1-R, recently updated with a Mark 2 version.</p>
<p>Our test GS1000S was top Sydney racer Neil Chivas' production bike. The model had covered a lot of hard miles and endured the odd slide down the road but still handled and went very well. Fairly small-sized Pirelli Phantoms were fitted front and rear and we were impressed by their grip under all conditions. Unfortunately they rendered the speedo nine percent optimistic instead of the usual four or five percent. All the speeds and fuel consumption quoted have been corrected to true figures.</p>
<p>Suzuki has increased engine power slightly for the S by going to 28mm Mikuni carbs (up 2 mm). Claimed power is up 6.9 percent to 69.4 kW (93 hp) although ou testbike's rearwheel power was only 4.4 percent up on the top figure for our previous testbike. Dry weight is also up slightly at 238 kg.</p>
<p>Like Kawasaki's Z1R, the GS1000S is a particularly good-looking mount in the flesh. A bikini fairing housing oil temperature and fuel gauges and an electric clock (eat your hearts out, Laverda owners!) as well as the mandatory speedo/tacho set, has been added to the basic GS1000 and the whole creation is finished in an eye-catching blue and white paint scheme guaranteed to get your average red-blooded American lady hot for a ride. Judging from the feedback we received during the course of the test, Australian females are no different: The bike evoked comments reminiscent of our much-praised Z1R testbike a year or so ago.</p>
<p>In spite of its attractive overall appearance (the good looking, but not light, alloy wheels help), the Suzuki can't match the classic handsomeness of the well-proportioned Laverda - the bike looks a triffle too fat from some angles. The GS' paint-work is up to the standard of the Kawasaki's ice-blue Z1R.</p>
<p>The fortes of the GS1000S are a repeat of the GS1000's - excellent frame, steering and handlinh, superb suspension (complete with air-forks) and a fairly low weight in Japanese terms for its engine size. Comfort is the one area where the Suzuki really socks it to the Laverda and while the GS ranks up with the best of them on tour, the Laverda extracts much too high a price for its racer-stiff suspension, particularly on Australian roads. The Z1R too, is quite unable to approach the sweet Suzuki's bum-pampering ride. The GS is also extremely easy to ride (thanks to its fine steering), very forgiving when a rider gets out of his depth and will appeal to all big bike buyers except those insisting on shaft-drive.</p>
<p>Self-cancelling blinkers and a halogen headlight (at last) are fitted on the GS1000S, but in most other areas the S is identical to its touring counterpart. Smaller, flat handlebars are used on the sportster and we found these very comfortable for all types of riding. They're just about perfect.</p>
<h1>Engine</h1>
<p>The Suzuki's powerplant is a mildly tweaked version of the familiar GS1000 four, which in turn was basically a bigger GS750. Both engines have proved ultra-relaible; even though they haven't been on the market as long as Kawasaki's venerable big four, buyers can expect durability of a similar standard.</p>
<p>Running an oversquare bore/stroke of 70 x 64.8 mm, the powerplant displaces 997 cm3 and runs a compression ratio of 9.2:1. Like the GS750 and Z1000, the bottom end is all roller and gear primary drive is used. Carburetion is through 4 x 28 mm Mikunis (like the Z1R). They're the old slide type without accelerator pumps although these are to be changed later this year. The engine exhausts into four headers leading to two well-tucked-in silencers which do a good job of making the engine note agreeable without robbing too much power. Laverda could take a lesson here; the Jota pipes are just too damn rorty. Ignition is by battery/coil (agricultural?) triggered by breaker points, and lubrication is wet sump. The double overhead cams driven by an automatically-tensioned roller chain operate two valves per cylinder.
</p>
<p>So much is the engine your "average Japanese four" it's even a bit dated (no CDI and only two valves a pot) but it is a handsome mill as Suzuki's casting is first class and the deep finning has an attractive shape. Mid-range performance is punchy and this, combined with the GS' moderate weight, makes the bike satisfyingly responsive in everyday riding. In short, we think the powerplant is well-suited for the bike.</p>
<p>Starting the GS was always easy (only electric start is available) and the engine only needed a brief warm-up with the choke on. Its running under these conditions was a trifle rough, as have been all recent Suzuki four-strokes, but once the choke was turned off the engine behaved impeccably.</p>
<p>While the GS1000S is not as vibrationless as Yamaha's XS1100 with its rubber-mounted engine, we found our test bike very smooth, particularly in the 3-6000rpm range where one spends most of the time when touring. We thought the GS1000S smoother than both our previous GS1000 testbike and Kawasaki's Z1000 Mk 2. In practice, what vibes there are never intrude on rider comfort.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we achieved better fuel economy with the newer, hotter engine than from the tourer. Our best touring figure was an excellent 17.2 km/l (48.9 mpg), city riding returned 14.3 km/l (40.6 mpg) and hard riding 12.1 km/l (34.4 mpg), which isn't at all bad when one considers the performance available. The bike was overfilled with oil when we picked it up and was still overfull when it was returned although a small quantity of oil dribble across the top cylinder head fin as a consequence of fast country runs. At no time was there any sign of overheating.</p>
<h1>On the strip & dyno</h1>
<p>We hadn't expected the S to be any faster at Castlereagh than the GS1000 because even though its power was slightly up, so was its weight. But it was, by 0.1 secs over the 400 m, and for that we think Suzuki can thank the Pirelli tyres on the testbike. The tyres helped two ways - one, they gripped well and the GS came off the line very quickly indeed and, two, (probably more importantly) they were small-section tyres and lowered the gearing of the bike slightly. Even a very small change in gearing will pay dividends at the strip.</p>
<p>The GS1000S ran a best standing 400 metre time of 11.7 secs at 181 km/h and only the CBX has been down Castlereagh quicker (11.6 secs). The bike was dead easy to ride and times were consistent after a few "feeling out" passes. Unlike last year's test GS1000, which went on record as having the first clutch we've ever wrecked at Castlereagh, we had absolutely no trouble with the GS1000S' clutch. Its behaviour was perfect.
</p>
<p>Although all our strip runs were wheelspin starts with the front wheel well and truly on the deck all the time, slightly less hard street starts would see the front wheel lift a few inches and be carried there for a spell, usually through first gear. Again the bike was perfectly controllable at all times. Maximum speed, the engine spinning into the red because of the lower gearing, turned out to be a true 223 km/h with the speedo showing nearly 240 km/h.</p>
<p>The dyno was uneventful save for an extra cooling-off period for the tyres partway through the run. Surprisingly, the bigger-bore carbs not only bolstered top end, they considerably improved mid-range power as well. The GS1000S, while no better than the GS1000 at 2000 rpm, records a power hike at every engine speed above 2000 rpm. Peak power is up 2.7 kW to a very healthy 57.1 kW (up near XS1100 figures, although it is disadavanted by shaft-drive power losses) at 8500 rpm and peak torque is now 69.2 Nm at 7000 rpm compared with 61.7 Nm at 8000 rpm for the old model. The chart shows clearly the excellent torque spread of the S engine, in everyday riding the engine is very responsive from 3000 rpm upwards.</p>
<p>The collectors in front of the mufflers were already straw-colored when we picked up the bike (Chivas is no slouch) and there was no more discoloration during the dyno run. The fairing and close proximity of the master cylinder, short handlebars and instruments made tying the front of the bike down difficult, but that's hardly a criticism most buyers would be concerned about. All in all a most satisfactory engine, albeit without the brilliance of Honda's new 16-valve 750 for example.</p>
<h1>Transmission and clutch</h1>
<p>The GS1000S uses a perfectly conventional motorcycle clutch and gearbox (ie, wet, multiplate and constant-mesh five-speed respectively). Both worked very well on our testbike and we are quite unable to complain about any aspect of their operation. They were excellent. The clucth was memorable in that it would allow well-controlled slipping when needed yet still bite home hard when the lever was dumped.</p>
<p>Drivetrain freeplay - when the chain was properly adjusted - was less than on most superbikes. The internal gearbox ratios are well chosen and when the standard-sized tyres are fitted the overall gearing is ideal. As our testbike came, it was a trifle low-geared.</p>
<p>False neutrals?</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>The entire engine/transmission unit was always a pleasure to use and, when combined with the bike's sweet road manners, even the most routine, mundane rides become highly enjoyable.</p>
<h1>Handling, steering & suspension</h1>
<p>Suzuki's sophisticated suspension, fine steering and top-class handling have done for Japanese bikes what Holden's Radial Tuned Suspension did for Australian cars - that is, it forced competitor companies to pull their socks up. But even though Suzuki's rivals have almost stretched their socks over their knees, we have not yet come across another bike able to provide the GS1000S' mix of steering, handling and comfort. The bike's low weight, air forks and stiff frame and especially the sharp steering (which allows new riders to feel completely at home and in full command after only a minute or two in the saddle) give the GS1000S an all-round capability other bikes just haven't yet matched. One has to ride the big Suzuki to appreciate what other bike owners miss out on; in turn it is difficult for them to imagine how much better the Suzuki really is.</p>
<p>On all types of roads, at all speeds, one or two up, the GS1000S is simply superior - it is fast, forgiving, comfortable and secure and to us that places the GS significantly above any of its rivals, nice bikes though they may be.</p>
<p>It also pooh-poohs once and for all that favorite bogey of Italian bike owners - that one must have hard suspension to achieve top handling. Watch a Duke or Laverda chattering and skipping on a bumpy corner and then put the GS through the same corner, 20 km/h faster and see if you can even notice the bumps. The bike is so good it is downright embarrassing.</p>
<p>Ground clearance on the GS is good and comfort - one or two up - is excellent. Being one of those poor unfortunate afflicted by A.G.F.L.I.T.C. (girlfriend living in the country), I make a lot of trips along the same country roads, which is handy for comparing test bikes. My visit GS1000S-mounted was the most enjoyable trip I've ever made and I arrived particularly fresh and relaxed despite the high outside temperature and bug-laden air (my other favorites on this trip are the GS1000 tourer, GS850 shaftie, Z1300 Kawasaki six - a very nice tourer, and the CB750KZ Honda).</p>
<p>The GS takes any manoeuvres the rider cares to carry out in its stride; braking and changing lines mid-corner are accepted with not even a hint of protest. Flicking the bike about in S-bends is less tiring than on most Japanese one-litre machines and the handling of the bike in every way is exemplary.</p>
<p>We were curious to see whether the added weight of the fairing and extra instruments around the steering head had any adverse effect on the steering (it would have been a pity if the fine steering was blunted by the extra weight) and were pleasantly surprised to find very little. The steering is a shade heavier at parking speeds (it's still light) but it feels identical to the GS1000 tourer once under way properly. All in all, ten out of ten.
</p>
<h1>Braking</h1>
<p>Srubbing off speed is accomplished with the triple-hydraulic-disc set-up found now on most big bikes. The units are identical to those fitted to the tourer 1000 which we praised as excellent in our test of that bike. Although we couldn't quite achieve the same stopping distances with the S, the machine still ranks as an excellent stopper.</p>
<p>For some reason we couldn't discover, the brake lever came closer to the handlebar than most before strating the front brakes doing their thing. This took a little adjusting to, but in every other way - stopping power, fade resistance, feel - the brakes were entirely satisfactory and well up the high standard set by the rest of the bike. The GS1000S' stability under desperate braking was outstanding - you always felt the bike was helping the rider rather than testing him.</p>
<h1>General</h1>
<p>Two minor annoyances must be mentioned. The first is the two rearview mirrors which are attached to either side of the bikini fairing.</p>
<p>Being further away from the rider, their angle of view is relatively small, but worse is the fact that the rider's arms obscure at least 30 percent of their area. A bit more work here for next year's model Suzuki - mirrors are very important in city traffic.</p>
<p>The second gripe is the too-small-in-diameter handlebar grips. Numb hands were common touring (no it wasn't cold) from the tight curl of the fingers round the grips and some bigger grips would be far better.</p>
<p>Fuel tank size at 19 litres is reasonable for touring, but another three litres would be even better.</p>
<p>Servicing should be fairly routine for a four-cylinder bike, but the lack of electronic ignition means you'll still be paying for points replacements and timing adjustments. CDI is rumored for later this year too. The halogen headlight of the S is far better than the tourer's tungsten unit - it's still living in the dark ages.</p>
<p>Comfort for pillion passengers is excellent. The compliant rear suspension and plush seat coming in for particular praise. Passengers seem to fare as well as riders comfortwise, which is excellent.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Suzuki's updated 1000 hasn't lost any of its original strong points and the refinements have been worthwhile each time (the clock is a bit posey though).</p>
<p>It is arguably Japan's best superbike and may well be the world's finest.</p>
