<p><b>The Suzuki XR41 not only won the 1983 World Endurance Chanpionship, its progeny included the game-changing Suzuki GSX-R750.</b></p>
<p>Endurance racing is all about building a motorcycle with the perfect combination of speed, handling, reliability... and comfort. The riders - there is usually more than one - would be sharing their bike for hours on end, often through the night. With a few exceptions such as the Honda Elf and the 750cc four-cylinder two-stroke OW31 Yamaha, classic endurance racers were based on road motorcycles. And that appealed to road riders, especially in France, which had a long history of 24-hour marathons that were a heady mix of racing and partying.</p>
<p>The FIM introduced the World Endurance Championship for the 1980 season. Engines had to be based on production models, with a capacity of up to 1000 cc and standard piston stroke and carburettor choke dimensions. This effectively outlawed the RCB Hondas that had come to dominate endurance racing.</p>
<p>But there was nothing in the rules to stop private constructors or manufacturers modifying the chassis. Honad France won the first championship, although the Suzuki factory, which entered Yoshimura-tuned GS1000 specials with suspension and brakes from an RG500, surprised many by winning two rounds. Kawasaki won the world endurance title in 1981 and 1982 with its K1000J based racer, but Suzuki had not been twiddling its corporate thumbs. Its new endurance racer had been timed at over 175 mph in January 1981, but it had lost its star rider in a crash at the Suzuka test track. Suzuki would finally triumph in 1983 with the XR41 - also known as the GS1000R.</p>
<p>While the 997 cc DOHC inline four road bike on which it was based used a tubular steel frame, the XR41 featured a full-cradle frame made of box section alloy tubing. As aluminium has one third the density of steel this meant that the frame could be just as stiff but almost 10ib lighter. It was not a new idea - Yamaha had used box section alloy frames on its 500 cc GP bikes in 1979.</p>
<p>Instead of twin shocks, the rear suspension used Suzuki's Full Float system, a name coined to describe the movement of the suspension unit's mountings. The centrallly mounted Kayaba monoshock, with its remote reservoir, was not fixed rigidly to the chassis. Instead, the lower end was bolted to a bridge on the swingarm, just behind the swingarm pivot, while the upper end was fixed to one side of a rocking beam that pivoted about its centre. An inverted U-frame connected the rear of the rocking beam to the swingarm at the point where the normal vertical shocks would be bolted. The geometry of the suspension was fully adjustable to give the ideal progressive rise and stiffness, which gave the rider a much better feeling of what the tyre was doing. Eighteen-inch wheels were used to make changing brake pads easier during a race.</p>
<p>The GS1000 donor engine was air-cooled. Suzuki considered water-cooling, but this would add more than 4.5 kg and also increase the width of the engine. Instead it tried something different - oil-cooling. This was not a new idea. Aircraft engines including the Rolls-Royce Merlin that powered the Second World War Spitfire used jets of oil to cool the pistons, and Suzuki developed oil cooling for the XN85 Turbo road bike. Nozzles on the back side of the crankshaft sprayed oil on to the underside of the piston crowns to cool them. This allowed Suzuki to fit lighter pistons and so reduce reciprocating weight. More oil was carried in an extra sump made from welded sheet alloy, and there was also a second pump to increase the flow of hot lube to the larger radiator mounted under the headstock at a rate of 22 litres per minute. The combustion chambers were modified to take two spark-plugs. Power output was 135 bhp at 9800 rpm.</p>
<p>Based in France, the Suzuki Endurance Racing Team (SERT) was managed by Dominique Meliand. At the start of 1983 he had six XR41 racers at his disposal. His top riders were Herve Moineau, another Frenchman who had won the 1980 Endurance Championship with Marc Fontan on a Honda, and the 10-time Belgium national champion Richard Hubin. They were the same weight and height, which made setting up the Suzi a lot simpler. The opening round at the Le Mans 24-Hours didn't go as planned. Six hours into the race a piston broke up, but after an hour in the pits they were back on track. Then the camchain snapped. The race was won by a Kawasaki ridden by reigning champs Jacques Cornu and Gerard Choundry with Sergio Pellandini (three riders were used for the 24-hours. Kawasakis also took second and thrird place.
</p>
<p>Meliand's HB Suzukis were better prepared for the UK round at the 4.71 km Silverstone circuit, which Moineau and Huban won convincingly after six hours. Then came one of the toughest challenges of the title chase - the 20.83km Nurburgring. They were lapping the circuit every eight minutes, but it wasn't quite good enough and the Suzuki pair finished 75 seconds behind Cornu and Choundry after covering 1229 km. They were beaten into second spot by another works Kawasaki, this time ridden by Jean Lafond and Patrick Igao, at the 1000 km Osterreichring race in the Austrian mountains. Suzuki's teamsters were back on form to win the eight-hour Spanish round at Jarama, where Moineau went past the leading Kawasaki in the last few minutes. Meliand's yellow HB Suzuki also won the Japanese round in Suzuka, but placed second to Kawasaki in Belgium's 24-Hours at Spa-Francorchamps.</p>
<p>The final round took place on September 25 at the 5.245 km Mugello track near Florence. Moineau and Hubin were leading the championship by a slender nine points from Lafond and Igoa. With only 30 minutes left Moineau's bike developed a misfire and he stopped to have a new battery fitted, which dropped him to fifth place. Lafond was running in second place, and if that was how the race ended the Kawasaki and Suzuki riders would tie for points. Tean tactics can make a big difference. Meliand called in his third HB Suzuki, which was circulating in fourth place, to 'change the brake pads'. Moineau was instantly elevated to fourth place and that was enough to take the title from Kawasaki by 89 points to 84, although the constructor's title went to Team Green with a convincing 109 points to Suzuki's 95.</p>
<p>Then Suzuki dropped a bombshell - there would be no factory Grand Prix team the following year, and it was unlikely that it would be making special engines for endurance racers to 750 cc in 1984. But the yellow rockets left a lasting legacy. Suzuki married the XR41 chassis to a 750 cc version of the championship-winning engine to make a production racer and a road bike - the GSX-R750 supersports that debuted at the 1984 Cologne Show.</p>
