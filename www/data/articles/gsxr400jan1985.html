		<p><b>The  fierce battle for dominance of the 400 cm3 bracket in Japan has thrown up some top little sportsters. Presently the leader of the pack is Suzuki's GSX-R400. It'll do for Australia as well!</b></p>
		<p>Since Yamaha's XJ550 set new standards for the middleweight class three years ago, engine and chassis refinements have been the mainstay for improvements, with little being achieved in the area of weight reduction. Until Suzuki's GSX-R400.</p>
		<p>Using many of the race-derived ideas employed in the soon-to-be-released GSX-R750, the 400 is the start of what we hope will be a new era of sports motorcycling. Although it's no open class competitor it is nevertheless a worthy contender in the 600 cm3 bracket, and one of the nicest sportsters we've had the pleasure to test.</p>
		<p>In the flesh the 400 oozes sporting appeal &ndash; from its stunning twin headlights and full fairing to its adrenaline-pumping 12000 beats per minute, four-chamber heart. Other attention-grabbing items are the triple-disc, ten-piston braking system and the superbly crafted alloy frame.</p>
		<p>Such beauty would be wasted without a willing soul; Suzuki has ensured delivery of the goods by reworking the motor of the GSX400 FW. Work has centred around breathing efficiency, with a redesigned cylinder head giving 18 percent greater valve area and a more hemispherical combustion chamber shape. Compression ratio has been increased to a high 11.3:1 while the incoming mixture is metered through a pair of 30 mm twin-choke Mikunis. On the exhaust side a well-tuned set of four-into-ones ensures efficiency while contributing a significant weight saving over a conventional four-into-two setup.</p>
		<p>As could be expected, such detailed work has not been in vain; Suzuki claims a very healthy 42.5 kW at 11000 rpm while maximum torque is 37 Nm at 9000 rpm. On that basis, the 400 is only 3.8 kW behind Suzuki's own 550 and near enough as powerful as Yamaha's RZ350 stroker. Impressive ain't it?</p>
		<p>On the road the story's just as good with the only deficiency of the powerplant being a fairly weak and uninspiring midrange trade-off for the excellent top-end urge. Despite this debit the motor remains smooth and tractable and will pull cleanly from only 3000 rpm in top gear.</p>
		<p>Such is not the case when approaching the motor's redline, however. Suzuki has fitted a rev-limiter to the engine's ignition system which cuts in at 12 200 rpm. While this may seem a reasonable way to curb the engine's willingness to spin in practice the system is little more than a bloody nuisance. All too frequently when using the excellent top-end the engine would bounce off the rev limiter, requiring an immediate upshift at often inconvenient moments. The system would best be served by having it activate at a higher revs (say 13 000 rpm). If the motor can't take this sort of punishment (occasionally) then perhaps Suzuki should lower the power band and redline accordingly.</p>
		<p>On the brighter side of things other engine functions were in the &ldquo;better than expected&rdquo; category, with fuel consumption being particularly good. Unlike its sporty two-stroke brother, the RG250, the GSX-R is unlikely to drink your mate's 1100 under the table. The test bike's frugal appetite rarely saw it consume more than a litre every 19 kilometres. At best the bike returned an excellent 22 km/l while even a thrashing around Oran Park saw no less than 15.6km/l.</p>
		<p>This reluctance to drink heavily also showed occasionally on cold mornings when some coaxing would be required to get the little mill to fire. Once it was going, however, the coolant would quickly reach operating temperatures and the bike could be ridden away almost immediately without protest. One curious aspect of the cooling system is the electric fan. Not only is it tiny, and seemingly puny, but it failed to come on even when subjected to fairly high temperatures on the dyno. A quick 12 volts across the terminals showed it to be operative, so we can only assume a thermostat switch that was faulty or had an unusually high setting. Either way, considering the reluctance of the coolant to boil the fan would seem an unnecessary extra.</p>
		<p>The bike's coolant system wasn't the only thing to prove its mettle on the dyno. Asked the question, the motor unleashed a healthy 32.1 kW at 11 000 rpm with a peak torque figure of 28.5 Nm at a thousand revs less. While the closeness of these figures would appear to put the GSX in the super-peaky bracket, such is not the case on the road. Power delivery is still progressive and the torque curve is relatively flat. This is not to say that the 400 is any sort of powerhouse in the midrange - just that it can be ridden through its rev range with little hesitation.</p>
		<p>Although we were unable to run our full performance figures, some extensive testing at Oran Park gave us a good indication of what the little R will do. Standing 400 metre times of 12.8 seconds with a terminal velocity of 165 km/h should be readily available given the bike's low weight and gearing, while we saw a corrected top speed of 195 km/h. While these figures are impressive, so is the relative ease with which they are achieved. The super light dry weight of 157 kg and small frontal area ensure that getting the R off the line and keeping it charging hard are no problem. The bike revs out quickly in every gear but top (which saw an indicated 11 700 rpm), and gives acceleration beyond 100 km/h that belies its small capacity.</p>
		<p>In the scartching and touring roles it's necessary to keep the engine boiling between 8000 and 12000 rpm to extract its best, but the six well-chosen gear ratios and light, positive clutch take the chore out of cog-swapping.</p>
		<h1>New transmission tune.</h1>
		<p>The 400's designers have opted for a novel variation on the six-speed gearbox theme. Most other bikes just have their ratios fitted into a similar overall spread to a five-speeder, with the higher gears being quite close to the other to maximise outright performance. The Suzuki has what is effectively a conventional five-speeder, topped by a huge gap to an overdrive sixth, a chasm nearly as big as that between second and third. The first five cogs are comparatively low, and aid the sparkling acceleration off the mark. Top speed is best achieved by running out to redline in fifth, for the bike is very reluctant to pull to it in sixth On the other hand, because the sixth cog is so long (1500 rpm below peak power at a flat-road maximum) it gleefully takes advantage of any slight tailwind or downslope.</p>
		<p>But the real advantage of the approach is found at less frantic speed. Instead of an overtaking manoeuvre from 110 km/h demanding the double downshift of every other six-speeder, the GSX will deliver the goods after a single twitch of the left ankle. It's a very welcome attribute.</p>
		<p>Matched against the King of the middies, the RZ350, the Suzuki acquits itself with distinction. It can't top the two-stroke's muscle in a top-gear roll-on from medium gighway speeds, but uses its lower gearing to keep the other bike at bay in an out-and-out drag from a standing start.</p>
		<p>In the city the story is not quite as good and unless you're satisfied by pottering along with the traffic it's likely you'll spend most of the time exercising the left foot and hand. There's one consolation though - the wail from the exhaust in a built-up area is enough to stir the blood (and warn the traffic) at any speed.</p>
		<p>Although competent in any role, the GSX-R's real forte is in the fast swervery where its great handling and balance can be exploited. Suzuki's frame and suspension setups have been among the best lately and the 400 is no exception. Wrapped neatly around the little mill is Suzuki's latest aluminium box section frame, an item derived from the factory endurance racer. It is a gem of welding and bracing and contributes greatly to the weight saving and handling prowess of the bike. Suspension performance too reaches high standards, with the rear being particularly good. The system performed extremely well under a variety of load and road conditions and, despite over-zealous riding, the rear-end could not be provoked to step out of line. Also good, if not as brilliant, was the front end, with a well-braced set of forks offering a compliant response and good damping properties. The dual hydraulic antidive systems performed their task well without being an overactive as some similar set-ups.</p>
		<h1>Bend-swinger supreme</h1>
		<p>With such a list of credentials, it's not surprisingly that the GSX-R400 handled the bends with the best of them. In its element the little R is untouchable by all but the RZ350, with the outcome of any such battle being a matter of rider more than bike.</p>
		<p>On tighter roads, the RG250 and Kawasaki's KR250 will close the gap but cannot match the four-stroke for pace out of and between the corners. At the other end of the spectrum nothing bigger than the 400 will be able to shake its twin-headlight gaze until the corners open up to less interesting angles.</p>
		<p> Much of the fine handling must be attributed to the steering characteristics of the GSX. Although some riders may find the steering a little too quick and light, the level of precision and response invoke the term "thought input" rather than rider input - anything different couldn't be as good.</p>
		<p>Another benefit in corners is the excellent cornering clearance and good standard rubber. Despite some serious attempts on our behalf the only item to ground was the sidestand frame lug on the left side while nothing on the right is within reach of anyone but lunatics and road-racers. Wheels are the same lightweight items used on the little RG, although they now wear a set of Bridgestone Battlax boots rather than the Michelin items of the smaller bike.</p>
		<p>Generally the tyres held on well, wet or dry, although when extended they were prone to the occasional slide. One other aspect that could have been caused by a bad batch of tyres or just plain bad luck was the rear tyre's attraction for pointy objects. Twice during our two weeks with the bike it was deflated by such like - the first being an unlikely piece of wood. Apart from this the tyres are well suited to the bike and the 100/90-16 front and 110/90-18 rear would seem the optimum choice for the normal road use.</p>
		<h1>Pistons everywhere!</h1>
		<p>Although Suzuki already had a good braking system on the shelf. it has opted to develop a new one for its R series bikes and the RG500. The decapiston braking system, as Suzuki likes to call it, employs fixed dual twin piston (four spot) calipers operating on a pair of 236 mm slotted discs on the front and fixed twin piston calipers and small 210 mm disc at the rear.</p>
		<p>While some may consider a ten-piston, tripple-disc setup an overcomplicated indulgence on a 400 cm3 motorcyle, it's hard to level criticism at something that's an obvious an improvement over its predecessors.</p> <p>Power and, to a lesser extent, feel, in the front brakes is top notch, while good feedback and a progressive lever effort allow the pilot to dial in the required level of retardation right up to a crash stop, that has the rear wheel lifting off the road. The rear brake, while less interesting in specification, is well up to the task although the transition from hard braking to wheel locking is a little hard to pick. Overall, though, the new system is a definite improvement over the rather dead setup of the GSX550EFE.</p>
		<p>Some people may feel the twin headlights of the GSX-R would look better on a Holden Premier, but there's no denying their practical advantage.</p>
		<p>With two lenses beam penetration can be gained without the loss of short range spread while cut off - both on high and low beams - is superior to most single lens items. With only 35/35W globes fitted, however, the lights lack the penetration power of the Honda CBX750 items and would better exploit their design if the normal 60/55W globes were fitted. Another indirect benefit of the twin headlight arrangement is the associated increase in fairing width, which gives the striking red, white and black fairing better rider coverage. In this respect it is superior to most other sports fairings we've encountered. The fairing-mounted mirrors also benefit from the width to give a fuzz-free view of what's lurking behind.</p>
		<h1>From the cockpit</h1>
		<p>Behind the fairing the ancillary equipment is a mixture of good and mediocre. On the good side are the RG-styled instruments for engine and road speed as well as coolant temperature plus idiot lights for the usual items. Also good are the two-piece alloy bars which are well suited to the riding position, while less satisfactory is the fiddly switchgear and feeble horn. </p>
		<p>Futher back, the 18-litre fuel tank offers a useful touring range, (in the vicinity of 350 km), while a well-padded seat gives good rider comfort over reasonable distances. Passenger comfort is a little less satisfactory because of the high footpegs and precarious perch so two-up riding will generally be restricted to the foolhardy or the brave. </p>
		<p>Other areas for complaint are the dim ancillary lights, the lack of a centrestand and a terriblle sidestand. While we acknowledge the contributions these make to weight savings and cornering clearance, the trade-off in convenience and safety are hard to justify and a problem that Suzuki's engineers need to attend to.</p>
		<p> On the topic of engineering faults there's just one more bitch. The tool kit is mounted under the right-hand sidecover which is secured by a screw, presumably for security reasons. Trouble is, the screwdriver's in the tool kit. Well at least you can ask a passing housebreaker for a loan of a screwdriver; he's bound to have one in his kit.</p>
		<p> Overall, however, the GSX-R400 is an excellent motorcycle and these niggling flaws do little to detract from its road abilities. As a sportster it has an engine, chassis and styling that come together in a hard-to-fault package. As a tourer, commuter and packhorse the R has its limitations, but the trade-off is these areas should need little justification for the sports enthusiast.</p>
		<p>At $3549 the GSX-R400 may not be cheap; but in terms of fun value it's a bargain.</p>
